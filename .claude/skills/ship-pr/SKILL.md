# Ship a PR

## How this is invoked

**The owner types this at the *start* of a session, not the end.** The argument is either the
task in their own words, or a pointer to a `.notes/01-todo/*.todo.md` — sometimes just the file,
meaning "the first unfinished item on it". Resolve that before doing anything: if the target is a
todo file, run `node infra/scripts/resolve-todo-citations.mjs <file>` and surface anything it
reports as `STALE` rather than acting on that citation, then read the file. If the target is
ambiguous, name the line you are about to implement and say so rather than guessing.

Because you are invoked before the work exists, the whole arc is yours: plan, build, then ship. Take
it to merged. Come back for the two stops below, for a decision that is theirs to make, or when
something is actually wrong — not for progress reports.

## The rules that are irreversible if forgotten

Everything else in this file is mechanics you can re-read. These five cost something you cannot get
back, so they are stated here, first, where a truncated copy still carries them.

- **Two real stops: the plan before anything is built, and a check-in before the PR is opened.**
  A lack of objection is not approval at either.
- **Never review your own work and call it a review.** A subagent you prompt inherits your framing.
- **Merging forfeits the CodeRabbit review permanently** — it refuses a closed PR outright. "Review
  now or not at all", never "review now or later".
- **Never report work verified on the strength of the code looking correct.** Run the check, quote
  what it printed. Anything that renders in a browser gets `browser-verifier` before the PR opens.
- **Strike the shipped line from `.notes/` after the merge, not before** — and only what the merge
  actually finished.

## The steps

Run them in order. The two stops are real stops — work does not continue past them on an assumption,
and a lack of objection is not approval.

0. **If this is a problem rather than a change, load `problem-solving` first.** "Make the picker
   choose the pool" is a change. "Why does the drill list go stale" or "how should we handle X" is a
   problem, and going straight to a plan produces a confident answer to the wrong question. When
   unsure, it is a problem.
1. **Dispatch `monorepo-planner` to investigate and report.** It reads the code rather than
   remembering it, and it cannot edit. When the task is a `.notes/01-todo/*.todo.md` item, give it
   the item verbatim in that file's format, not a re-typed summary — reflowing it loses the inline
   `[a]` citations, which resolve only against the original References list. Anything settled
   verbally goes alongside, clearly separated from the verbatim block, never merged into it or used
   to reword it. Not your own theory of the fix, which is the thing that would contaminate it.
2. **Attack the plan before believing it.** A plan you only read is a plan you approved, and you
   framed the task the planner worked from — so auditing it yourself is the same self-review this
   skill forbids for code.

   **Dispatch `plan-adversary` when the change is more than mechanical**, meaning any of: it spans
   more than one workspace; it moves runtime, build, auth, data or CI behaviour; it touches more than
   about five files; or the planner left an open question or an unverified claim. Otherwise check the
   claims yourself — a one-file constant change does not repay a round trip. Either way, call
   `advisor` when the *shape* of the change is in doubt rather than its details.

   A `DO NOT PROCEED` goes back to step 1 with the finding, not around it.
3. **Present it so it can be skimmed, then wait.** What becomes true, the files grouped by
   workspace, the reasoning that is not visible in a diff, what you rejected, and what would make it
   wrong — in that order, scannable. **Once the owner approves, build the task list.**
4. **Dispatch `monorepo-implementer` with the approved plan, in a worktree unless the plan touches
   `.claude/`.** A `.claude/` change stays in the main checkout — a worktree's own `.claude/` is
   never scanned, so what governs a worktree session is the main checkout's working tree, not the
   branch's (root `CLAUDE.md`, Workspace section, has the full mechanism). It builds exactly that,
   commits in logical steps, and stops rather than improvising if the plan turns out wrong. If the
   change touches a browser surface, **dispatch `browser-verifier` before you report done** — it
   holds the Chrome tooling so this context does not have to, which is what makes honouring that
   rule cheaper than skipping it.
5. **Check in — in the owner's terms, not the code's.** What was done and why, the decisions the
   plan left open, what you ran and what it printed, what you could not verify. It must be
   understandable without opening the diff, because it will be read without opening the diff. Then
   stop, unless they have said not to.
6. **Once they are satisfied, open the PR.** Body per the section below.
7. **Arm `watch-pr.sh`** — it waits for every required check, pings CodeRabbit once they are green,
   and arms auto-merge once the review clears: immediately on a clean one, or after the reply-and-fix
   cycle on one with findings. **Wait for the watcher to report before handing the
   PR to a fresh reader** — it runs under `Monitor`, so it is still working while you read this
   line, and a reader dispatched now gets a branch whose checks have not reported. If that fresh
   reader *is* the pre-merge review, run with `SHIP_PR_AUTO_MERGE=0`, or the PR can merge out from
   under it.
8. **Merge once everything clears,** then strike the shipped line from `.notes/`.

Steps 1 and 4 are delegated on purpose: a fresh context re-derives from the code, where you would
re-derive from your own earlier reasoning. Skip them only on the fast lane below. Dispatch and keep
working: the synchronous form is almost never the right one, because checking the planner's claims
against the code and reading what it reports on both run alongside it.

**A subagent is opaque while it runs.** You get its final report, not its progress, so a *delegated*
task's status moves at the delegation boundaries: mark it in progress before dispatching, update it
when the report lands. Do not write status you cannot see — a task list that reports a subagent's
internal state is inventing it. This is a limit on delegated tasks only; the work you do yourself
closes when it is done.

**One dispatch is one task, however many pieces it covers.** Five tasks flipped together report five
workstreams you cannot see; the pieces you will check afterwards are verification checkpoints and
stay pending until you have checked them.

**Every subagent's own file rejects a resumed message that doesn't begin `VIA ORCHESTRATOR: `** —
so when you send a follow-up to a subagent you dispatched (`SendMessage` to an agent that already
reported, or mid-task), that prefix has to be yours, every time, not assumed. This exists because a
message can reach a dispatched subagent from somewhere other than the session that dispatched it —
the owner testing it directly, a misrouted message meant for a different session — and a subagent
with no way to tell that apart from a real follow-up has acted on it: pushed, opened, and closed a
PR from one, none of it authorized by anyone actually orchestrating that run. Forgetting the prefix
on a message you actually mean makes your own follow-up bounce, which is the safe failure — the
subagent replies with its fixed refusal and does nothing, rather than doing the wrong thing.

### The fast lane, for a change too small to pay for the flow

Step 2's thresholds decide whether a plan needs an adversary. These are tighter, and decide whether
the flow runs at all. On a one-line fix, the three dispatches and the signal pass above cost more
than the work. Take the fast lane when **all four** hold, and say in the check-in that you took it:

- one workspace
- about two files or fewer
- no runtime, build, auth, data or CI behaviour change
- no browser surface

Then: plan inline, in a few lines, under every rule in `monorepo-planner`'s own file — read the code
rather than remember it, label what you did not verify — and present it: **stop 1 stays**, it is
only shorter. Implement inline, under every rule in `monorepo-implementer`'s own file, commit shape
included. Run the narrowest relevant checks. Open the PR with the full body standard. Run
`pr-signals.sh` inline. Arm `watch-pr.sh`. CodeRabbit reviews it. Merge.

**What the fast lane never skips: both stops, the PR body standard, every required check green, and
a fresh reader.** Those are the contract — only the ceremony scales, which is why this is a section
here rather than a skill of its own.

Fail any of the four and you are on the ordinary flow. A change that moves runtime behaviour in one
file is not small: what makes a dispatch worth its cost is what the change can break, not how many
lines it touches.

**To move an agent off its default tier, name an effort skill in the dispatch prompt.** Each agent's
`effort:` frontmatter is fixed for every dispatch — the `Agent` tool takes a `model` parameter but no
`effort` one — so "tell it to invoke `effort-xhigh` first" is the only per-dispatch lever, and a
skill's effort outranks the agent's. Raising it is the case worth remembering: `monorepo-implementer`
sits at `medium`, which is right for following an approved plan and thin for a large one.

`CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` outranks both, so where it is set the knob is inert and nothing says so —
check the environment before concluding a dispatch ran at the level you asked for.

## Before opening anything

Run the narrowest relevant checks for what changed before opening the PR, not after. `pnpm check` is
the normal gate; `pnpm verify` when the change spans workspaces or touches runtime/build behaviour.
In root `package.json` those two differ by exactly one word — `verify` adds `build` to the turbo run
— so the question is only ever "could this break a build". A PR opened red wastes a CI cycle and
buries the real signal.

**The browser check happens before the PR is opened**, not after CI goes green — a green PR is what
makes it feel skippable. Which surfaces need it, and how, belong to the root `AGENTS.md` rule and to
`browser-verifier`; what this skill adds is only the timing and the dispatch.

## Opening it

**Write the title and body for a person, not for a changelog generator.** The owner works in
PM-mode and does not read diffs line by line, and — see the next section — the pre-merge review is
done by a reader with no access to this conversation. Both of them get the PR body and nothing else.
A body that only lists what changed is unreviewable: it gives them no way to tell correct from
plausible. If working from `.notes/01-todo/`, use the pr name the todo item lists, with the items
description quoted in the body in the owners own words.

Conventional commit for the title, and the scope after the type is the workspace or surface, not a
file. The rest of the title should read as a sentence a human would say — what the change makes
true, not which symbols moved.

```text
feat(cflop): make Drill's picker choose the pool instead of filtering the list   ← yes
feat(cflop): refactor case-selection.ts and add setCasesEnabled                  ← no
```

The body must carry three things, in this order:

1. **The requirement.** What the owner actually asked for, in their terms — including anything that
   was settled verbally and exists nowhere in the code. Wording they rejected and the wording they
   chose. Behaviour they specified that a reader would otherwise assume was your invention. **This
   is load-bearing**: a fresh reviewer can check "is this sound" from the diff alone, but can only
   check "is this what was asked" if the ask is written down here. If it came from a
   `.notes/01-todo/*.todo.md` line, quote the line.
2. **Why, before what.** Lead with the problem — what was wrong, what it cost, why the obvious
   alternative was not taken. The *what* follows from it and is usually the shorter half. If a
   decision has a non-obvious reason (an ordering that prevents a silent no-op, a hook owned by one
   component because two copies would desync), that reason belongs in the body; it is exactly what
   a reviewer cannot reconstruct and will otherwise flag as arbitrary.
3. **What you could not verify.** Plainly. If a fix is precautionary rather than demonstrated, say
   so — do not let it read as a proven fix.

## Gather what the reviewer cannot see

Some findings never reach a reviewer because they live in GitHub rather than in the diff, and the PR
body is the reviewer's whole input — so a finding left in a dashboard is a finding nobody reviews.
Nothing else collects these for you; `/code-review` does not.

**Run the script yourself once the checks are green** and read the JSON:

```sh
.claude/skills/ship-pr/scripts/pr-signals.sh <pr>
```

The script does not collect bot comments — a bot that reports as a passing check and puts its
findings in a comment is invisible to it. That is a second one-line read, not a reason to dispatch:

```sh
gh pr view <pr> --comments
```

Everything from `coderabbitai[bot]` there belongs to `watch-pr.sh` and is not this step's business.

**Read the exit status before the arrays.** `pr-signals.sh` exits non-zero when it cannot resolve
the PR, and a run that failed prints no findings for exactly the same reason a clean one does. Treat
a non-zero exit, or a JSON object missing any of its keys, as *unknown* and fix it — never as clean.

On a zero exit, all three empty — `introduced`, `unresolvedThreads`, and any bot comment that is not
CodeRabbit's — means **no new actionable findings**, which is not the same as no findings:
`preExisting` alerts can still be there and are worth a sentence in the body. Then move on.
**Dispatch
`pr-signal-collector` only when one of them is not**, because triaging an introduced alert against a
pre-existing one, or deciding what a bot's comment actually claims, is judgement neither read
carries. A dispatch to be told the categories are empty is a dispatch that read a file you already
read.

## Review before merge — hand off to a fresh reader

**Do not review your own work and call that a review.** By the time the PR is open you have already
convinced yourself the code is correct, and any reviewer whose input passes through your summary
inherits that conviction. A subagent spawned from this session gets a fresh *context* but not a
fresh *framing* — you still write its prompt, choose what it looks at, and decide what is settled.

**Every required check must be green before you request any review.** Not merely reported — green. A
reviewer pointed at a branch that then goes red reviews code you are about to change. CodeQL and the
`Images` matrix both land well after the PR opens, and CodeQL can fail on a *new* alert introduced by
the diff even when its own workflow succeeds, so "the PR opened without complaint" tells you nothing
yet. For CodeRabbit that wait belongs to `watch-pr.sh` and you arm it straight away; for any other
reader it is on you.

Four readers, in preference order. **The mechanics of each — how to invoke it, what it costs, and the
traps — are in `.claude/skills/ship-pr/reference/review-ladder.md`. Read that file before picking.**

1. **CodeRabbit — the default.** Request it by arming `watch-pr.sh`, which waits for green and posts
   the ping itself. The only reviewer that is a *different tool* rather than a different context, so
   it does not share your model's blind spots. Its cost is latency, not budget.
2. **The `code-review` workflow, when CodeRabbit is rate-limited.** Pre-authorized — you may spend it
   without asking. **Floor is `high`**; `low` and `medium` review inline, which is the self-review
   this section forbids. Expensive: ~2M tokens for one PR. One at a time.
3. **A reviewer subagent** — the cheap option, and the one to prefer on a small diff. Give it the diff
   and the PR body, not your reasoning.
4. **`/code-review ultra` — a handoff to the owner, for a large or security-sensitive change.** You
   **cannot launch it**; attempting it silently falls back to an inline review that never touched the
   cloud, and reporting that as `ultra` reports something that did not happen. It bills money rather
   than the five-hour window.

**Options 1 to 3 are yours to run unaided; only 4 is a handoff.** Do not ask the owner to open a fresh
session and read the branch by hand — it buys nothing option 3 does not, and it costs them a session.

Whichever runs, its input is the PR body — which is why the section above matters. Triage its findings
the same way as CodeRabbit's: verify each against the code before acting.

## Watching the checks

Every required check on `main` must report before merge is possible. Read the list from the rules
GitHub says apply to the branch rather than from memory:

```sh
.claude/skills/ship-pr/scripts/required-checks.sh
```

`Images` exists because `Verify` is Vite and tsc only and never touches a Dockerfile — a dependency
can pass every other check while making the deployable image unbuildable.

A PR branched before a merge to `main` reports `BEHIND` and cannot merge until updated. `gh pr
update-branch <pr>` fixes it and re-runs every required check, so it is another full CI cycle —
budget for it rather than treating the first green as the last.

**Do not block the turn waiting.** `gh pr checks <pr> --watch` is one notification after *everything*
reports, so a `Verify` failure two minutes in stays invisible until the slowest job finishes ten
minutes later — you sit on a fixable red the whole time. **Arm this under `Monitor`, not `Bash` with
`run_in_background`** — background Bash notifies once, when the script exits, which is the same
blindness by a different route. `Monitor` is a deferred tool, so its own guidance on which to pick is
not in context until you fetch it; that is why the choice is stated here rather than left to it. One
stream now carries both the check results and the review outcome, which makes that choice matter
more, not less. `--help` for the script's outputs and exit codes:

```sh
.claude/skills/ship-pr/scripts/watch-pr.sh <owner/repo> <pr>
```

**The checks come before the ping, and that is the script's property rather than your instruction.**
A ping fired while CI is still running spends a slot on code a red check is about to change, so
`watch-pr.sh` refuses to post one until every context `required-checks.sh` names has reported green.
The gate is the *required* list specifically: `gh pr checks` reports only what exists on the head
commit, so a fast third-party app answering first makes a partial list look complete, and a red
non-required check would hold back a ping that should go out. A red required check, a `BEHIND` or
`DIRTY` branch, and a draft PR each end the run without pinging.

On a clean review it stops watching the checks at the ping. A successful arm does not end the run
either way — the watcher polls past it, reports `merged <sha>` once GitHub squashes, and if a
required check goes red or the head moves after the arm, reports that too with the exact
`gh pr merge --match-head-commit` command to re-arm by hand. On a review with findings it does not
exit at the ping outcome — it waits for every thread to clear and re-checks required checks on the
new head before arming, per `reference/coderabbit.md`.

If a check fails for a reason unrelated to the diff (flake, infrastructure), say so explicitly rather
than silently re-running.

## CodeRabbit comments

**The full mechanics are in `.claude/skills/ship-pr/reference/coderabbit.md`** — every ping outcome and how to tell them
apart, the commit-status vocabulary, the rate-limit arithmetic, what `watch-pr.sh` does at each step,
and how to handle the findings. Read it before arming the watcher, and again if a ping produces
nothing. What stays here is only what is irreversible if forgotten.

**It does not run automatically.** `.coderabbit.yaml` sets `reviews.auto_review.enabled: false`, so a
review happens only when asked for. Ask by arming `watch-pr.sh`, which posts the ping itself once
every required check is green. Do not type the ping as well.

**A passing `CodeRabbit` check does not mean the PR was reviewed.** It is `pass` either way — on a
review that ran, one that was skipped, and one that was rate-limited. The signal is the check's
*description*, never its state.

**One review per PR, not one per push.** Once it has reviewed, that budget is spent: fix what it
found, push, and merge on the required checks. A second ping is earned only by a real defect with a
substantial fix, and you say in the merge report why you spent the slot.

**CodeRabbit will not review a merged PR — there is no second chance.** A ping on one answers
`✅ Action performed` / `Full review finished.` while the walkthrough carries `Review failed / The
pull request is closed`. So merging unreviewed forfeits the review **permanently** rather than
deferring it. That is what makes the merge exceptions narrow, and why the default on a cooldown is to
wait rather than merge.

**A refused ping is not a review.** Rate-limited means nothing was read, so re-pinging after the
cooldown is still the *first* review. Default to waiting: under ~30 minutes, or whenever the owner is
away and wall-clock is free, waiting is the cheap side of the trade. When you do merge unreviewed, use
`watch-pr.sh --no-review` rather than a merge you assemble yourself — it keeps every other guard.

**Do not push while a review may still be finishing.** The body can land minutes before CodeRabbit is
done, and a push in that window aborts the rest with `Review failed / The head commit changed during
the review`.

**Reply to every item** — fixed, refuted, and deliberately-not-acting-on alike. A thread with no reply
is indistinguishable from a thread nobody read. Verify each claim against the code first; if it is
wrong, reply with the evidence rather than applying a change you cannot justify. If it is taste that
contradicts a documented convention, the convention wins — link it.

**A reply is not enough to unblock the merge — `watch-pr.sh` waits on `isResolved`, not on reply
existence.** For anything fixed, CodeRabbit's own follow-up commit resolves the thread and the wait
clears on its own. For anything refuted or deliberately not acted on, resolve the conversation by
hand in GitHub's UI after replying, or the run waits out `SHIP_PR_THREAD_WAIT_TIMEOUT` (45m default)
and stops rather than merging.

Do not let an unresolved advisory comment's *substance* block a merge — refute it and resolve the
thread. Do let a real defect it surfaced block one.

## Merging

Merge once every required check is green, **a fresh reader has reviewed the branch**, and review
comments are handled. Report what actually happened: which checks ran, who reviewed and how, what
was raised and how each was resolved, and anything left undone.

The fresh-reader precondition has exactly four exceptions. Three are about a reviewer being
*unavailable* rather than unnecessary: the owner is actively waiting on this PR, the PR blocks other
work, or CodeRabbit's cooldown is long and the diff trivial. The fourth is the owner asking for an
unreviewed merge outright — theirs to ask for, and the reason `watch-pr.sh --no-review` exists rather
than a merge command an agent invents on the spot. A rate-limited CodeRabbit on its own is not one of
them — that is a reason to *wait*, and the arithmetic is in `reference/coderabbit.md`.
Taking an exception means naming which in the report, and running it through `--no-review`, which
keeps the merge preconditions the review path applies.

Name the reviewer too: CodeRabbit, `/code-review` or a subagent because CodeRabbit was rate-limited,
or `/code-review ultra` because the change was large or security-sensitive. If none happened, say so
outright rather than letting "checks green" stand in for "reviewed" — and say it if you spent a
second CodeRabbit review, with why the findings earned it.

**Merging is the point of no return for CodeRabbit** — "review now or not at all", never "review now
or review later" (`reference/coderabbit.md`). That is what makes the exceptions above narrow.

`gh pr merge` may print `fatal: 'main' is already used by worktree at ...` when run from a worktree.
That is `gh` failing to check out `main` locally *after* merging; confirm with
`gh pr view <pr> --json state` rather than assuming the merge failed.

## After the merge: strike the shipped line from `.notes/`

This is the owner's scratch file on disk, not the harness task list — that one is yours and is
already finished by now.

If the owner started this session by pointing at a `*.todo.md` in `.notes/01-todo/`, delete the
line(s) the merged work completed from that file once the PR is merged — not before. Leaving a
shipped item on the list is what makes the list stop being trusted.

Scope rules:

- Only when the task was **initiated from** a todo file. Do not go hunting for entries that happen
  to resemble what you shipped.
- Delete only what the merge actually finished. If the item was partially addressed, leave the line
  in place and add an indented sub-bullet under it recording the status — what shipped, what is
  left, and the PR number. Never rewrite the original line — the owner wrote it and it stays their
  wording.
- `.notes/` is gitignored, so this is a local scratch edit with nothing to commit or push. Do not
  add it to the PR and do not stage it.
- Name the exact line(s) you removed or annotated in your final report.

## When to stop and ask

- A required check is red for a reason you cannot fix inside the PR's scope.
- CodeRabbit surfaced something that implies a design decision rather than a fix.
- The change turns out to need a dependency, tooling, or architectural choice — those are the
  owner's call, presented as options with a recommendation.
- Merging would land something the owner has not seen and would plausibly object to.
