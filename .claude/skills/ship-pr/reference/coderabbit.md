# CodeRabbit — full mechanics

Loaded on demand from `ship-pr`. Read this when a CodeRabbit review is in flight: before arming
`watch-pr.sh`, when a ping produces nothing, or when deciding whether a review actually ran.


CodeRabbit is **advisory and non-blocking**, and it is **not a required check** — it must never gate
a merge. Its comments are leads to verify against primary sources, never conclusions to act on.

"Non-blocking" never licenses merging with no review at all — when it is rate-limited, see "Wait out
the cooldown and re-ping" below. The four cases that do license one are listed there, along with the
flag that carries them out.

## Ask for the review — it does not run automatically

`.coderabbit.yaml` sets `reviews.auto_review.enabled: false`, so a review happens only when asked
for. **Ask by arming `watch-pr.sh` — it posts `@coderabbitai full review` itself.** Do not type the
ping as well; the section below covers what a second ping costs.

Arm it once, when the diff is finished — batch every outstanding fix into one push first. Arming
before the diff is settled is the mistake that survives: the script will not ping ahead of green, but
it will happily ping a diff you are about to change again, and that slot is spent.

**The "✅ Action performed / Review finished" ack carries no information — not that a review ran, and
not that one failed.** It lands within seconds of *any* ping, identical every time, and it is **not**
edited afterwards: measured on PR #185, the ack body was byte-identical before and after the review,
and the outcome landed in a separate summary comment. So watching the ack for a change waits forever.
Reading a fast ack as failure is how a real review gets missed; reading it as success is how an
unreviewed PR gets merged. **Confirm by state**, using the tables under "Confirming a review actually
ran".

The one thing the ack does carry is a receipt: `<!-- CodeRabbit review command invocation: <uuid> -->`
in its body, one per ping. Two acks with different uuids are two pings.

**CodeRabbit will not review a merged PR — there is no second chance.** A ping on one gets
`✅ Action performed` / `Full review finished.`, with no rate-limit marker and the count still at
baseline, while the walkthrough comment carries the real outcome in a collapsed block:

```text
Caution
Review failed
The pull request is closed.
```

So "Full review finished" is the text for a review that never started. A PR merged unreviewed is
unreviewed permanently — only `/code-review` or a fresh session on the merge commit is left — which
is the real cost of merging past a cooldown, and why the default below is to wait. Observed on a
merged PR; closing without merging, and reopening, are untested.

**The command form does not decide whether a review happens — the rate limit does.** `review` and
`full review` both trigger, and both are refused by the limit with `Review limit reached` on a window
that has not refilled. Do not go hunting for the magic wording when a ping produces nothing; check the
limit.

**One CodeRabbit review per PR**, not one per push. Once it has *reviewed*, that PR's budget is
spent: fix what it found, push, and merge on the required checks **without** asking it to look again.
A finding too large to fix inside this PR's scope becomes a follow-up PR with its own single review.
Every run spends a per-developer slot, and a wasted slot is not recoverable for minutes to hours.
(*Unverified*: that this installation is on Pro Plus, and that its limits are adaptive so sustained
pinging makes them tighter. `@coderabbitai configuration` on an open PR reports the plan; nobody has
run it here.)

**A refused ping does not count as the review.** Rate-limited means nothing was read, so re-pinging
after the cooldown is still the *first* review, not a second one. Only a ping that actually produced
a review spends the budget.

**A second ping is earned only by severity.** If the first review surfaced a real defect — silent
data loss, a security or auth hole, a correctness bug that ships wrong output — and its fix is
substantial rather than a one-liner, that fix is new code nothing has reviewed, and the second ping
is right. Seven nitpicks earn nothing; one data-loss bug with a real fix does. Say in the merge
report why you spent the slot.

## Rate limits, when you do hit one

**A passing CodeRabbit check does not mean the PR was reviewed — the bucket never tells you.** It is
`pass` either way. The signal lives in the check's *description*, and only there. Measured on the
same PR, before and after a manual ping:

| Description | What actually happened |
| --- | --- |
| `Review skipped: automatic reviews are disabled` | nothing ran — `.coderabbit.yaml` sets `auto_review.enabled: false`, so this is every PR's resting state |
| `Review completed` | a review ran |

This is the same commit status tabled in full under "Confirming a review actually ran" below, seen
through the checks list instead of the API.

So a green `CodeRabbit` row read at a glance is the thing most likely to wave an unreviewed merge
through, and reading it *early* is how you conclude the check is meaningless — it is not, it is just
stale until a review finishes. `watch-pr.sh` prints the description alongside the bucket for this
reason. Every other check here has an empty one, so the annotation appears only where it carries
information. The `CodeRabbit` row is deliberately not part of that script's green gate — it is `pass`
on every PR, so gating on it would be reading the signal the review wait exists to discriminate.

Confirm a review from the review itself regardless; the description says one ran, not what it found.

A rate-limited run reports `pass` with the text `Review rate limited` — measured on PR #236,
alongside comments in both the older and newer wordings below. The newer comment names a spent
**quota** ("Your included review limit is currently reached under our Fair Usage Limits Policy"),
not a short wait: its own countdown did not hold on the PR it was measured on — the re-ping after it
expired was refused again with a fresh short countdown of its own. Treat two rate-limit refusals in a
row on the same PR as the budget being spent for now, not as a cooldown that just needs longer.

1. Check the summary comment for the marker — either `rate limited by coderabbit.ai` or the newer
   `Review rate limited.`
   (`gh pr view <pr> --json comments`, grep `rate limited`).
2. **The countdown — "Next review available in: N minutes" on the older wording, "next included
   review will be available in N minutes" on the newer one — is not a live clock**, so polling for the
   marker to vanish can wait forever and the deadline is the comment's **`updated_at` + N**, not
   `created_at` and not "now + N". CodeRabbit has been seen posting both wordings for the same
   refusal, seconds apart; `coderabbit-deadline.sh` prefers whichever one actually carries a readable
   countdown, not just whichever is newest:

   ```sh
   .claude/skills/ship-pr/scripts/coderabbit-deadline.sh <owner/repo> <pr>
   ```

   A window that has already lapsed still reads "rate limited" — check the arithmetic before
   assuming you must keep waiting.

### Ride out a short cooldown; escalate past a long one — never merge unreviewed just because you were refused

A refusal is not a review, and a short cooldown is worth riding out: that is cheaper than merging
blind and cheaper than the follow-up PR a missed finding turns into.

**How short is not yours to judge.** `watch-pr.sh` rides one out up to `SHIP_PR_MAX_COOLDOWN` and
refuses anything longer, printing `refused: rate limited, cooldown <n>m exceeds threshold`. When it
refuses, **that is the answer** — CodeRabbit is not reviewing this PR. Do not re-arm the watcher
behind a `sleep`, do not poll for the window to lapse, and do not raise the variable to make a long
one fit. A free wall-clock is not a reason to wait: a reviewer arriving an hour later reviews a PR
the session has already moved past, and the ladder in `SKILL.md` has readers that answer in minutes.

So a refusal escalates rather than blocks. Take the next reader down the ladder — a
`pr-review-toolkit` subagent on a small diff, the `code-review` workflow at `high` on a large one —
and merge with `--no-review` below, naming in the report both that CodeRabbit never reviewed it and
who did instead.

Merge with no reader at all only when the owner is actively waiting on this PR, when it blocks other
work, or when the owner asks for an unreviewed merge outright. Say which in the merge report.

**Carry that out with `watch-pr.sh --no-review`, never with a merge you assemble yourself.** It waits
for the required checks, then waits for every review thread to clear the same way the findings path
does (below), then re-pins to the live head and arms — no ping, no review wait. It still ends on a
`BEHIND` or `DIRTY` branch, still declines on a draft PR, on unresolved review threads left open past
the wait, and on a PR state it could not read. A hand-rolled `gh pr merge` skips every one of those,
which is the actual risk of leaving this path unsupported: the review gets skipped either way, and
the improvised version drops the guards as well.

So the flag is not a fifth case, and it excuses nothing. It is how the four above are done. **The
armed line's wording now reflects whether this PR was ever actually reviewed, not whether this
particular run skipped the ping**: `--no-review` checks `review-count.sh` live before arming, so a PR
resumed with the flag after a real review already ran gets the ordinary armed line, and only a
genuinely never-reviewed PR gets `auto-merge armed UNREVIEWED on <sha>`. `SHIP_PR_AUTO_MERGE=0`
outranks it either way, for when you want the wait skipped but the merge left to a person.

To wait: **arm a `Monitor` and carry on working.** This is the case `Monitor` is for — an outcome that
arrives on someone else's schedule, with no way to know which of five endings it will be.

```sh
.claude/skills/ship-pr/scripts/watch-pr.sh <owner/repo> <pr>
```

No `2>&1` — the script exits 1 rather than run with its streams merged, for the reason under
"Watching the checks" in `SKILL.md`.

**Arm it and do not ping — it pings for you.** It waits for the required checks first, then pins the
head sha and takes the review-count baseline, then posts `@coderabbitai full review` and records
GitHub's own timestamp for it. The baseline is taken after the wait rather than at arm time, so a
review that lands during CI cannot be read as one the ping produced. That
timestamp is the whole discriminator afterwards, which is why the ping has to be the script's: a
manual one alongside it is a second slot spent, and it moves the marker the script does its cooldown
arithmetic on, so the automatic re-ping then fires early into a live window and burns the retry cap
on a refusal.

A cooldown that is already live when you arm it is ridden out *before* the first ping, so the ping is
spent on the far side of it. That first ping does not consume the retry: the cap counts refusals
absorbed, not pings posted. If its one automatic re-ping is refused too, it stops and says so — the
window was longer than advertised. Two refusals in a row on a lengthening window is the point to stop
*waiting*; it is not itself a reason to merge. That still turns on the exceptions above, and where
none of them holds it is the owner's call, because merging forfeits the review permanently rather
than deferring it.

The one case where the ping is yours: `SHIP_PR_AUTO_REPING=0` on a PR whose cooldown is live at arm
time. It says so and exits without posting anything. `--help` carries every outcome it prints.

Cooldowns here have run to minutes, not hours, and a five-minute wait has bought a review that found a
real defect. Waiting is usually the cheap side of this trade.

## Confirming a review actually ran

**Do not count inline comments.** Findings can arrive as "outside diff range" body text with no
inline comment at all, so read the newest review's **body** too. Read instead: the review count
against the baseline taken before the ping
(`.claude/skills/ship-pr/scripts/review-count.sh`), unresolved threads
(`reviewThreads` via GraphQL, `isResolved == false`), and the summary comment's markers.

**Replying to findings inflates the count, and `review-count.sh` filters that out.** CodeRabbit
files a review object for every thread reply it posts, so its acknowledgement of your reply raises
the raw count without any review having run. Measured on PR #187: the raw count read 11 where three
reviews had actually happened, and a genuinely **clean** third review was reported as
`reviewed: 10 -> 11` — the arm that means "it found something", which is why auto-merge never fired.
The script now counts only reviews carrying a body. If you read the count by hand, apply the same
filter.

**The count only moves when there were findings.** A review that comes back clean leaves it exactly
where it was, so `count == baseline` is ambiguous between "still running", "never ran" and "ran and
found nothing" — and only the summary comment tells them apart. Never treat a flat count as evidence
either way.

**Every outcome a ping can have.** The count rises for exactly one of them, so a loop keyed on the
count alone hangs on all the others. Everything but the last row is measured here; that one is read
from upstream and marked as such.

| Outcome | How you know | Ends the wait? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reviewed, findings | count > baseline — counting only reviews with a **body**, see above | yes — triage them |
| Reviewed clean | `No actionable comments were generated in the recent review` — **count stays at baseline** | yes |
| Rate-limited | `rate limited by coderabbit.ai`, or the newer `Review rate limited.`, or the `Review rate limited` commit status | yes — cool down, re-ping |
| Merged PR | `Review failed` / `The pull request is closed` | yes — CodeRabbit is done, forever |
| Head moved mid-review | `Review failed` / `The head commit changed during the review from <a> to <b>` | yes — see below |
| Ping never registered | the commit status below reads `Review skipped: ...` with an `updated_at` **later than** the ping | yes — re-ping, nothing was spent |
| Nothing reviewable | `did not have any reviewable changes` | yes — that *is* the review |
| Still running | `review in progress by coderabbit.ai` | no — keep waiting |
| Draft PR | *(unverified: `drafts` defaults false, so drafts are excluded from auto-review; whether an explicit ping overrides that is untested — mark the PR ready before pinging)* | — |

**The best signal in this section is a commit status, and it is not in the checks list you read from
`required-checks.sh`.** CodeRabbit posts one on the head sha through the legacy status API, context
`CodeRabbit`. Read it combined, which returns the latest per context:

```sh
gh api "repos/<owner>/<repo>/commits/<head-sha>/status" \
  --jq '.statuses[] | select(.context=="CodeRabbit") | "\(.updated_at) \(.description)"'
```

| Description | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| `Review queued` | accepted, nothing started |
| `Review in progress` | running |
| `Review skipped: automatic reviews are disabled`, `updated_at` **before** your ping | this repo's resting state, on every PR from the moment it opens |
| `Review skipped: ...`, `updated_at` **after** your ping | the ping was swallowed |
| `Review completed` | it stopped — read the summary comment for what it found |
| `Review rate limited`, `updated_at` **before** your ping | a refusal already ridden out, nothing new to act on |
| `Review rate limited`, `updated_at` **after** your ping | this ping was refused — ride out the cooldown and re-ping |

Three traps. **`state` is useless**: measured `success` for the skip, the completion and the rate
limit alike, so never branch on it — the `updated_at` is the whole discriminator. **Statuses are per
head sha**, so pin the sha you pinged on; a push landing after the review leaves the new head carrying
only the resting skip. And the vocabulary is **undocumented** — five descriptions across three PRs,
absent from the yaml reference, the commands guide and the plans page — so treat an absent context as
"fall back to the summary comment", not as an answer.

**The waiter can merge for you on the clean row, and on the findings row too, on different terms.** On a clean review it arms GitHub's native auto-merge immediately,
pinned with `--match-head-commit` to the sha that was actually reviewed; GitHub then squashes once
every required check passes, so nothing here re-verifies green or races a branch that goes `BEHIND`.
A push landing between the review and the arm makes the arm fail outright — measured, see below — and
a push landing *after* a successful arm is caught too, see below.

On a review **with findings**, it does not exit at `reviewed: <base> -> <n>`. It prints
`findings: <n> unresolved review thread(s) — reply and fix` — on stdout, once, so it reaches a
`Monitor` caller, which never sees the stderr heartbeats — and waits for every
review thread to clear (`unresolvedThreads`, `isResolved == false`, the same check the clean row's
arm already used defensively — reused rather than duplicated, so the two can't disagree), then waits
for required checks to go green again on whatever head that leaves, then re-reads the live head sha
and arms on it. **Say this plainly, because it's a real weakening and not a rounding error: the sha
this arms on was never reviewed by CodeRabbit.** One ping per PR, by design — see below — so a fix
commit landing during this wait gets no second look from the bot. What stands in for that review is
every thread having cleared plus checks being green on the sha that's about to merge, not a
sha-equals-reviewed-sha guarantee. The final head-read-then-arm step only narrows the very last round
trip to the same shape as the residual race already accepted elsewhere in this script (a push landing
in that one round trip is unflagged); it does not make the whole wait race-free.

**Because the thread check is `isResolved`, not "a reply exists," a refuted finding needs a manual
GitHub step.** Replying with evidence and no code change does not itself clear the gate — either
CodeRabbit marks the thread resolved on its own (observed once, for a *fixed* finding, not confirmed
for a refutation) or you click "Resolve conversation" in GitHub's UI. Skip that and the run waits out
`SHIP_PR_THREAD_WAIT_TIMEOUT` (2700s / 45m by default) and stops with a line telling you to reply and
re-arm or resolve by hand — not a hang, but a real extra step this repo's workflow didn't have before.

Both rows decline to arm on a draft PR, on any unresolved review thread left open past the wait, and
on a PR state it could not read. `SHIP_PR_AUTO_MERGE=0` turns either off. No other outcome qualifies:
a refusal read nothing, and `did not have any reviewable changes` is an unreviewed merge in a clean
one's clothes.

**That `--match-head-commit` pin is the whole safety argument for the default being on, and both its
paths are now measured.** Controlled pair on PR #187 — same command, same PR state (checks pending,
`BLOCKED`), only the sha differing. Pinned to a **stale** sha it was refused, `GraphQL: Pull Request
is not mergeable`, with `autoMergeRequest` left `null`; pinned to the **current** head it armed. So
`expectedHeadOid` is enforced when auto-merge is *enabled*, and an arm attempted after a push simply
does not take.

Enable-time enforcement says nothing about what happens after, and GitHub's docs name only two things
that disable an armed auto-merge — a push from a user **without** write permission, and switching the
base branch. **A required check going red is not one of them: the arm survives it and fires on its own
once that context reports green again on the same head sha.** Measured on a scratch repo — one required
context, armed while it was already red (which GitHub accepts, so arm order does not matter), then
flipped red to green with no new commit, and the squash landed two seconds later. Two caveats on the
measurement: the required context was a hand-posted commit status rather than an Actions check run, and
there was one of them rather than eight.

**On both rows the watcher polls past every successful arm** rather than leaning on GitHub's silence. It
watches required checks and the live head sha, reports `merged <sha>` once GitHub squashes, reports a
red required check as survivable, and reports the head moving — which genuinely does break the arm —
with the exact `gh pr merge --match-head-commit` command to re-arm. On the findings row this sits
alongside the pre-arm recheck: the post-review wait re-checks required checks once, right before
arming, and a red check there is caught and reported (`— not arming`) before the arm is attempted.

Unmeasured: whether GitHub's auto-merge updates an out-of-date branch by itself. Read as no, and the
failure direction is benign either way — a self-update moves the head sha, which the watcher's polling
catches the same as any other post-arm push.

**A ping can be swallowed with no marker at all.** Observed here: `@coderabbitai review` drew no ack
and no review, while the PR-open `Review skipped` notice sat above it looking like a reply. The
discriminator is time, not position — whether the status or a CodeRabbit comment was written *after*
your ping. Re-pinging costs nothing when the count never rose, because nothing was read.

**Do not push while a review may still be finishing.** The review body can land minutes before
CodeRabbit is actually done, and a push in that window aborts the rest with
`Review failed / The head commit changed during the review from <a> to <b>`. Confirm the findings you
have match the body's `Actionable comments posted: N` before pushing anything.

`Review skipped` carries opposite meanings on its two surfaces. In the **checks list** it is the
nothing-happened state; in the **summary comment**, followed by `did not have any reviewable
changes`, it is a finished review of a diff with nothing in it — a pure deletion earns that, and its
count never moves.

`did not have any reviewable changes` is therefore **reachable on a normal PR**, not only on a pure
deletion: `.coderabbit.yaml` sets `reviews.path_filters` excluding generated paths, so a PR touching
only those has nothing left for CodeRabbit to read. Read that outcome as a real answer, not a fault.
The other skip triggers still cannot fire here — no `base_branches` or `ignored_titles` are
configured, and the auto-pause after N reviewed commits applies to incremental auto-review, which is
off.

**A zero read once is not an answer — and a zero read forever is not one either.** The count sits at
the baseline for as long as the review takes, so an early zero is indistinguishable from "never ran".
But a clean review never moves it, so waiting for it to rise can outlast the review by the whole
timeout. Both readings are settled the same way: by the summary comment, not the count. Do not report
the outcome of a review still in flight — say it is still running, or wait.

**Reply to every item** — the ones you fixed, the ones you refuted, and the ones you are deliberately
not acting on. A thread with no reply is indistinguishable from a thread nobody read, and the owner
cannot tell which from the outside.

1. Check the claim against the actual code yourself.
2. If it is right, fix it and say so in the reply.
3. If it is wrong, reply with the evidence. Do not apply a change you cannot justify independently
   just to clear a comment. It concedes to a demonstrated counterexample, so the reply is worth
   writing properly rather than just dismissing.
4. If it is a matter of taste that contradicts a documented convention in `AGENTS.md`, the
   convention wins — link it in the reply.

**Then push the fixes and watch the threads — do not ping again.** The push earns no new review, but
CodeRabbit *does* answer replies on individual threads, and that answer is where it either concedes
or produces a counterexample you have not seen. A reply that raises something new is a finding in its
own right. The thread you argued and then stopped reading is the one that costs you.

```sh
.claude/skills/ship-pr/scripts/watch-threads.sh <owner/repo> <pr> <since>
```

`<since>` is a UTC timestamp from before you replied, e.g. `2026-07-31T18:04:00Z`. It reads
`pulls/.../comments` — review-thread replies, a different endpoint from the `issues/.../comments` the
summary comment lives in. Arm it as a `Monitor` if you would rather the reply found you; `--help` for
the rest.

Do not let an unresolved advisory comment block a merge. Do let a real defect it surfaced block one.
