# The reviewer ladder — full mechanics

Loaded on demand from `ship-pr`. Read this when picking a pre-merge reviewer, and before invoking
the `code-review` workflow or handing off `ultra`.

## Pick by what the change is

1. **CodeRabbit is the default, and you request it yourself** — by arming `watch-pr.sh`, which waits
   for the required checks to go green and then posts the ping. Arm it once the diff is final; the
   waiting for green is the script's job, not yours (the exact mechanics are in `coderabbit.md`
   beside this file). It is the only reviewer that is a *different tool*
   rather than a different context, so it
   does not share your model's blind spots — that is what makes it the first choice rather than the
   consolation prize.

   Its cost is *latency*, not the owner's budget: the plan is free but rate-limited, so a wasted slot
   delays the next review instead of billing anything. That is the opposite trade from `ultra` below,
   and it is why CodeRabbit is the default even on a small PR.
2. **If CodeRabbit is rate-limited, run the workflow-backed review yourself.** The owner has
   pre-authorized this skill's review step to spend it without asking each time — which is what
   separates it from `ultra` below. Do not sit out the window with no review at all.

   **You do not type the slash command; you invoke the workflow.** `/code-review
   [low|medium|high|xhigh|max|ultra] [--fix] [--comment] [<target>]` is the *owner's* surface. Yours
   is the `code-review` skill, and it resolves to exactly one call:

   ```text
   Workflow({ name: "code-review", args: "<level> <target>" })
   ```

   **`args` carries the level and the target and nothing else.** Verified in the binary: the command
   strips `--fix` and `--comment` before building `args`, and honours them by appending instructions
   to *its own caller* — they never reach the workflow. So there is no `--comment` to pass; posting
   findings onto the PR is something you do afterwards, by hand.

   **Your floor is `high`.** The level picks between two engines rather than turning one dial. `low`
   and `medium` return an inline review — this context, this model, your own work — which is the
   self-review `ship-pr` forbids; they cannot satisfy the fresh-reader requirement however
   the findings read. Only `high`, `xhigh` and `max` route to the background workflow, and the fresh
   contexts it spawns are what make it a review at all. The gate also requires an interactive
   session, workflows enabled, and `Workflow` in the caller's own toolset — fail any one and it
   silently reviews inline instead, so a review that comes back instantly did not run.

   So choose the lowest of those three that fits the diff, not the one that sounds thorough. Measured
   on `high`: 688.6k tokens by the fifth of seventeen agents, ~2M for one PR. Upstream calls a run
   "large" at 25 agents or 1.5M projected tokens; `high`
   is already there. **One at a time, never as a batch**, and say the five-hour figure out loud before
   launching — read it rather than inferring it from the absence of a complaint. The `PreToolUse`
   budget guard matches the `Workflow` tool only, not `Agent` dispatches, and it fails open when it
   cannot read the budget; the `PostToolUse` advisor reports the figure periodically, not on every
   call. Both are registered in the owner's `~/.claude/settings.json`, not in this repo — a fresh
   clone has neither, and nothing here verifies they are installed. If the guard fires, that is the
   answer and not an obstacle to route around. On an
   already-merged PR the right answer is usually neither: the spend is real and the code has shipped.

   **The target is free text and carries instructions** — `focus on error handling`, `only review
   src/foo.ts` — as well as a PR number, branch, ref range or path. Everything after the level in
   `args` is passed through, so a scope restriction belongs there rather than in a follow-up message.

   It runs in the background: keep working, and report what survives with `ReportFindings`, once,
   most severe first — not as prose.

   **A subagent cannot run this for you.** `Workflow` is stripped from every subagent's toolset
   unconditionally — upstream documents it in the same filter as `AskUserQuestion` and `ExitPlanMode`
   — so no arrangement exists where a spawned reviewer invokes it. Only the main thread keeps it.
3. **A reviewer subagent** is the cheap option, and the one to prefer on a small diff. Give it the
   diff and the PR body — not your reasoning, which is the thing that would contaminate it.

   **A review dispatch goes to a `pr-review-toolkit` agent or it does not happen.** Never
   `general-purpose`: it returns a report that reads exactly like a specialist's while carrying none
   of the review posture the specialists were written with, so a review that did not really happen
   is indistinguishable from one that did. The ban covers *review* dispatches only —
   `general-purpose` stays correct for search, investigation, and everything else this repo
   dispatches it for.

   Enumerate before concluding nothing fits — "no specialist fits", decided without listing them, is
   what produced the generic dispatch this rule replaces. What the plugin registers, and what each
   one is for:

   - **`pr-review-toolkit:code-reviewer`** — guideline compliance and general correctness.
     Applicable to *any* diff, which is what makes "nothing fits" almost always wrong. Default pick.
   - **`pr-review-toolkit:silent-failure-hunter`** — catch blocks, fallbacks, anything that can
     swallow an error. Whenever the diff touches error handling.
   - **`pr-review-toolkit:pr-test-analyzer`** — test coverage and quality, when the diff changes
     tests or should have.
   - **`pr-review-toolkit:type-design-analyzer`** — new or reshaped types: encapsulation,
     invariants, whether a wrong state is representable.
   - **`pr-review-toolkit:comment-analyzer`** — comments and docstrings against the code they
     describe.
   - **`pr-review-toolkit:code-simplifier`** — **not a reviewer.** Its own brief is to *apply*
     refinements "autonomously and proactively", so pointing it at an open PR rewrites the branch
     under it. Before the diff is final, or not at all.

   Dispatch the one that fits, not several. The plugin's `review-pr` command fans the whole roster
   out, and it is the owner's surface rather than this rung: it aggregates in the calling context
   instead of a fresh one, scopes off `git diff` instead of the PR body, defaults to a set that
   includes the editing agent above, and spends the five-hour window on agents with no surface on
   the diff.

   The roster is user-level — it installs under `~/.claude/plugins/`, outside this repo — so a clone
   without the plugin has no rung 3 at all, and a plugin installed mid-session is absent here and
   present next session. When it is missing, or the diff genuinely lands outside every entry above,
   fall to another rung: wait out CodeRabbit's cooldown, or run the `code-review` workflow at
   `high`. Never substitute a generic agent for an absent specialist — no review beats a review that
   reads authoritative and is not one.

   Breadth is not the point; a second opinion on the part that could be wrong is.
4. **For a large or security-sensitive change, hand off to the owner for `/code-review ultra`.** It
   is user-triggered and billed and **you cannot launch it**, so this is a handoff, not a task.

   **Do not try anyway.** An agent that attempts `ultra` does not get an error — the fallback forces
   the level to `max` *and* turns off workflow routing, so you get a plain inline review that never
   touched the cloud. It looks like it worked. Report `ultra` as run and you are reporting something
   that did not happen.

   **`ultra` is not the default, and its cost is money.** It runs on Claude Code's web infrastructure
   in a remote sandbox and bills usage credits — roughly $5–$25 a review, after three free runs on
   Pro/Max and none free on Team or Enterprise. That is a different currency from everything above,
   which spends the rolling five-hour window instead. A fleet of cloud agents on an ordinary PR buys
   findings CodeRabbit already had. Reserve it for two cases:

   - a **large** diff — many files, or a change spanning workspaces, where no single reader holds all
     of it at once
   - a **security-sensitive** one: auth or session handling, permission or role checks, the redirect
     allowlist, request validation at an input boundary, secrets and env plumbing, upload or quota
     limits, CI/CD and ruleset config, or the rendering of user-supplied content

   Neither of those is a judgement call you get to skip when unsure — escalate, the cost of asking is
   one message. Adding `--fix` makes the cloud review apply its own findings locally — offer it only
   when the owner wants the fixes taken on trust, since it removes the step where you check each one.

   **The handoff is one pasteable line and nothing else:**

   ````
   ```
   /code-review ultra <pr-number>
   ```
   ````

   with the real number substituted in, never the placeholder. Bare `/code-review ultra` reviews the
   current branch against the default one and needs no GitHub remote — that is the form to give when
   there is no PR yet, and it takes a plain-words note: `/code-review ultra check my auth changes`.

   **A PR number takes no note alongside it.** Multi-word text is attached as a note only when it is
   not a branch name or PR reference; combine the two and the command is *rejected*, asking the owner
   to rerun with just the number or without it. So a PR handoff is the bare line above and nothing
   else. Put the focus in the PR body instead, under a `## Review focus` heading — the body is the
   reviewer's input either way, and a note never changes what gets reviewed, only what the findings
   are related to. Write it as claims to check, not as emphasis:

   - "Confirm `<file>` still states X after the trim; nothing mechanical reads it."
   - "Verify the guard fails closed when Y is absent — it was only tested passing."

   not "pay attention to `<file>`", which tells a reviewer nothing it was not already going to do.

**Options 1 to 3 are yours to run unaided; only 4 is a handoff.** Do not ask the owner to open a
fresh session and read the branch by hand — it buys nothing option 3 does not, same fresh context and
same model, and it costs them a session.
