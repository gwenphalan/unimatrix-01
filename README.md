# Unimatrix-01

Unimatrix-01 is the TypeScript monorepo for the public site, API, tools, and
shared packages.

## Quick start

Use the pinned toolchain from `.node-version` and the root
`packageManager` field when you work locally.

1. Run `corepack enable`.
2. Run `corepack use pnpm@10.30.3`.
3. Run `pnpm install`.
4. Optional: Run `pnpm setup:local` if you want app-local `.env` files
   created before the dev loop starts.
5. Run `pnpm dev`.

For a freshly created worktree or other automation, you can replace the
manual bootstrap steps with `./infra/scripts/pnpm-with-pinned-node.sh
setup:worktree`. That command installs workspace dependencies with a frozen
lockfile, bootstraps local env files, and runs database migrations.

If your host runtime does not already match the pinned Node and pnpm
versions, use `./infra/scripts/pnpm-with-pinned-node.sh install
--frozen-lockfile` and `./infra/scripts/pnpm-with-pinned-node.sh dev`.

## What lives here

The workspace roster is `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; `AGENTS.md` carries the
per-package boundaries.

`content/home/index.md` is site copy compiled into the web bundle;
`content/blog` and `content/projects` are seed input for the content
database (`pnpm --filter @unimatrix/api seed:content`).
