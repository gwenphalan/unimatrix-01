/**
 * The admin app's chrome.
 *
 * It is a **tool** surface, not a content surface, so it takes
 * `@unimatrix/chrome`'s `./tool` shell: a collapsible section rail, dense
 * content region, no site nav tabs and no site footer. That split is
 * tool-vs-content rather than signed-in-vs-public (see the root `AGENTS.md`),
 * and an admin console is the clearest case on the tool side.
 *
 * `sections` is non-empty, so the shell renders the rail rather than a title
 * bar: the wordmark and `accountControl` move into it. `showFooter={false}`
 * turns off the footer entirely, which was the only place `homeHref` (the
 * absolute public-site URL) reached the page in this layout — the rail's
 * wordmark links `sectionsHomeHref` instead, so there is deliberately no way
 * back to the public site from admin chrome; `homeHref` is omitted rather
 * than passed and unused.
