       * Clerk's <SignIn /> needs to route its own internal sub-steps
       * (email code entry, MFA, etc). Two options integrate with
       * TanStack Router: `routing="path"` + a splat child route
       * (`/sign-in/$`), or `routing="hash"`, which keeps every sub-step
       * on this same `/sign-in` route and manages state via the URL
       * hash instead. We use `routing="hash"` here — it avoids adding a
       * splat route just for Clerk's internal navigation, and this app
       * has no other routes nested under `/sign-in` that would need to
       * coexist with a path-based splat.
       *
       * `forceRedirectUrl={target}` sends the user back to the service
       * that linked here after a successful sign-in; `signUpUrl` carries
       * the same (unvalidated) redirect_url so switching to sign-up keeps
       * the destination.
       *
       * `signUpForceRedirectUrl={target}` covers the OAuth "transfer" case:
       * signing in with a provider whose identity has no existing account
       * creates one, which Clerk completes as a *sign-up* — without this it
       * would ignore forceRedirectUrl and fall back to the auth app landing.
