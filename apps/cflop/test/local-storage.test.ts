/**
 * The CFLOP rebrand moved every key from the `cube-trainer:` namespace to
 * `cflop:`. Nothing in the app would report a failure if that dropped a user's
 * data — reads would just return the empty default and every case would look
 * unlearned. These tests are the only thing standing between the rename and a
 * silent wipe, so they assert against literal key strings rather than going
 * through the writers: a test that only round-trips through the new prefix
 * passes just as happily when the fallback is deleted.
