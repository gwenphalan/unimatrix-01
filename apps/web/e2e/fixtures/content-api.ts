 * Blog and project content is served by the API now, and the Playwright run
 * starts `vite preview` with no API behind it. Every content request is
 * therefore fulfilled here.
 *
 * The fixture mirrors the two entries the repository ships (and that
 * `pnpm --filter @unimatrix/api seed:content` imports), so the smoke
 * assertions keep checking real copy rather than lorem ipsum. It is
 * hard-coded rather than parsed from `content/*.md` at test time because
 * Playwright will not transpile package sources resolved through
 * `node_modules`, and depending on a prior `pnpm build` would make the smoke
 * suite fail for a reason that has nothing to do with the site.
 *
 * App-local by rule: `@unimatrix/e2e-helpers` is app-agnostic, and this knows
 * exactly what apps/web publishes.
