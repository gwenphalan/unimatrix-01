I'm an aspiring backend developer with a passion for cybersecurity and open-source collaboration. I have several years of experience with TypeScript and Node.js, along with some exposure to Unity (C#), Java, and Python. Currently, I focus on building Discord bots and open-source backend APIs.

I'm actively working toward a formal education in cybersecurity and pursuing my TryHackMe SOC Level 1 certification to strengthen my skills.

One of my core goals when working on new projects is to make something that doesn't belong to me alone. If a repository of mine gets forked and becomes something greater at the hands of someone else, then I've done my job correctly.

Growing up watching Star Trek, my ideals were molded by those of the Federation - liberty, equality, peace, justice, and progress. There cannot be progress without collaboration.
