# Deployment

Dokploy plus Traefik is the primary production deployment target for the
current runtime surface. The repo-owned Dockerfiles and Compose workflow live
under `infra/docker/`; this document covers how those artifacts map onto a
production deployment.

`vite preview` is useful for local smoke testing of the built web app, but it
is not the production web server for `apps/web/dist/`,
`apps/cflop/dist/`, or `apps/auth/dist/`.

Every `apps/*/Dockerfile` and `infra/docker/*-compose.yaml` referenced below is generated from
`apps/<app>/deploy.config.ts` — see `infra/docker/README.md`. The subdomain and container port
listed per service in this document are **not** sourced from that config and stay hand-maintained
duplication: `packages/deploy-config` deliberately holds no subdomain or Dokploy metadata (see its
`AGENTS.md`), so nothing generates or reads them.

## Default production topology

The default production shape is separate-origin:

- `https://site.example.com` -> web
- `https://api.example.com` -> api
- `https://cflop.unimatrix-01.dev` -> cflop
- `https://cube.unimatrix-01.dev` -> 301 to `cflop.unimatrix-01.dev`
  (pre-rebrand hostname; see "CFLOP service" below)
- `https://auth.unimatrix-01.dev` -> auth
- `https://admin.unimatrix-01.dev` -> admin

In this shape:

- the web image is built with `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com`
- the API runtime allows the public web origin through `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
- the cflop image needs no build-time or runtime env; it has no API
  dependency
- the auth image is built with `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com` and
  `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` for the shared Clerk application
- Traefik owns TLS termination and hostname routing
- the secrets service gets no hostname and no Domains entry at all — it is
  deliberately unrouted. That makes it unreachable from the internet; it does
  not make it private. See "Secrets service" below

### SPA build args now default in `deploy.config.ts`

`apps/web`, `apps/auth`, and `apps/admin` each build with production values
as their `ARG` defaults (see `apps/<app>/deploy.config.ts`), so a
`docker build` with no `--build-arg` produces a correct production image.
The Dokploy environment variables listed per service below
(`VITE_API_BASE_URL`, `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `VITE_AUTH_APP_URL`) are
consequently redundant with those defaults; they still take effect when
Dokploy builds, since an explicit `--build-arg` overrides a Dockerfile
default.

## Published GHCR images

CI's `Publish` job (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) builds every `apps/*/Dockerfile`
with no build args and pushes it to `ghcr.io/unimatrixcore/unimatrix-<app>` on
every push to `main`, tagged with the commit SHA and a moving `main` tag. The
packages are public. **Nothing deploys from them yet** — every Dokploy service
below still builds from the `build:` block in its own
`infra/docker/<app>-compose.yaml`, not by pulling a GHCR image.

## Dokploy service layout

Create one Dokploy service per `infra/docker/*-compose.yaml`, all from the same
repository and the same `main` branch, all using Dokploy's **Compose**
application type (not the plain Dockerfile application type).

### Web service

- application type: Compose
- compose path: `infra/docker/web-compose.yaml`
- environment variables (set in Dokploy's UI, not in the file):
  - `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com`
- Domains page: route `site.example.com` to the `web` service, container port
  `8080`

This `VITE_*` value is inlined into the bundle at **build** time, so it must be
present before the image builds (the compose file passes it as a build arg).
The public site is fully anonymous — no Clerk, no sign-in affordance, no
account-scoped UI. That surface now lives on `apps/admin`; see the admin
service below.

The web container is a static SPA container. Preserve SPA fallback behavior
inside the web container regardless of routing.

### API service

- application type: Compose
- compose path: `infra/docker/api-compose.yaml`
- Domains page: route `api.example.com` to the `api` service, container port
  `3001`
- health endpoint: `/health`

Required environment variable (set in Dokploy's UI):

```env
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://site.example.com,https://www.site.example.com
```

`HOST`, `PORT`, `NODE_ENV`, `LOG_LEVEL`, and `TRUST_PROXY=1` are already fixed
in `infra/docker/api-compose.yaml` for this deployment shape and don't need to
be set again in Dokploy.

**Persistent storage:** user settings and uploaded files are stored in SQLite,
so the API needs a durable volume or all user data is lost on redeploy.
`api-compose.yaml` already declares an `api-data` volume mounted at `/data`
(where the DB defaults to `/data/unimatrix.sqlite`) and sets
`DB_MIGRATE_ON_START=true`, so pending migrations are applied against that
volume automatically at container startup — no manual `db:migrate` step is
required in production. In Dokploy, confirm the volume is attached and mapped to
persistent host storage (Advanced → Volumes) so it survives redeploys.

Clerk auth is required in production: set `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`,
`CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, and `CLERK_JWT_KEY` in Dokploy's UI (all three, never
just some). See "Clerk setup" below.

Five more variables connect this service to the secrets store —
`SECRETS_BASE_URL`, `SECRETS_SERVICE_TOKEN`,
`SECRETS_INTEGRATIONS_MANAGE_TOKEN`, `SECRETS_PLATFORM_WRITE_TOKEN` and
`SECRETS_TLS_CERT_BASE64`. All five must exist in Dokploy before this stack is
deployed: an unset variable named in the compose file reaches the container as
an empty string rather than as absent, and the API's loader refuses an empty
value, so the stack restart-loops and every content route 404s. The ordered
procedure is under "Secrets service" below.

### CFLOP service

- application type: Compose
- compose path: `infra/docker/cflop-compose.yaml`
- no environment variables required
- Domains page: route `cflop.unimatrix-01.dev` to the `cflop` service,
  container port `8080`

Unlike the web service, the cflop container serves one HTML file per route and
answers an unknown path with a real 404. Do not add a catch-all in Dokploy or
Traefik that routes every path to the app: it would reinstate the soft 404 from
outside the container, where `infra/scripts/check-cflop-serving.sh` cannot see
it and the only symptom is unknown URLs quietly returning 200 again. The web
service keeps its SPA fallback (`apps/web/nginx.conf`) and is right to — it has
no per-route files to serve instead.

cflop has no API dependency, so it does not need an entry in
`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.

#### The pre-rebrand `cube.` hostname

`cube.unimatrix-01.dev` is the tool's pre-rebrand hostname and still has users
and links pointing at it. It permanently 301s to `cflop.unimatrix-01.dev` with
the path and query string preserved.

The redirect lives in Traefik on the Dokploy host, across two surfaces. Nothing
in this repository configures either one, so if the Dokploy service is recreated
from scratch both have to be re-added by hand — neither CI nor the image will
notice they are gone, and the only symptom is `cube.` quietly serving the app
again:

- `/etc/dokploy/traefik/dynamic/middlewares.yml` defines `cube-to-cflop`, a
  `redirectRegex` with `permanent: true`, alongside the `redirect-to-https` that
  Dokploy ships.
- the Dokploy domain record for `cube.unimatrix-01.dev` carries
  `middlewares: ["cube-to-cflop@file"]`. The `@file` suffix is load-bearing: the
  router is generated by Dokploy's docker provider, and an unqualified middleware
  name resolves inside the router's own provider, where this one does not exist.
  Dokploy appends `@file` itself only to the `redirect-to-https` it injects.

That domain record also has to keep pointing at a live service and terminating
TLS, or the redirect is never reached — a hostname Traefik has no router for
answers `526` through the proxy, indistinguishable from one that does not exist.
The middleware is attached to the websecure router only, so `http://cube.…`
takes two hops: `redirect-to-https@file`, then the redirect.

A Cloudflare Redirect Rule would also work, and was not chosen. There is no
per-host `cube.` or `cflop.` DNS record — both are served by the proxied
`*.unimatrix-01.dev` wildcard, and Redirect Rules only execute on proxied
traffic. Flipping that one wildcard to DNS-only would stop the rule firing with
no error anywhere. Traefik sits below that switch. Nginx-in-the-container was the
other candidate and would have been repo-owned, which is a real advantage; the
trade accepted here is that the redirect lives on the host instead, invisible to
anyone reading this repository.

#### Progress saved under the old hostname is unreachable

`localStorage` is partitioned by origin, so whatever a visitor accumulated under
`https://cube.unimatrix-01.dev` cannot be read from `https://cflop.unimatrix-01.dev`.
`apps/cflop/src/lib/local-storage.ts` falls back from the `cflop:` key prefix to
`cube-trainer:`, which covers the key rename within one origin and does nothing
across two. The old data is not deleted — a one-time hand-off page served at
`cube.` could still recover it — but until something does that, a redirected
visitor arrives with an empty profile.

### Auth service

- application type: Compose
- compose path: `infra/docker/auth-compose.yaml`
- environment variables (set in Dokploy's UI, not in the file):
  `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com`,
  `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...`
- Domains page: route `auth.unimatrix-01.dev` to the `auth` service,
  container port `8080`

The auth container is a static SPA container, same shape as the web and
cflop services. Preserve SPA fallback behavior inside the container
regardless of routing. It is the central Clerk-backed accounts app (landing,
sign-in/sign-up, and account management), so it needs `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` on
the API service to include
`https://auth.unimatrix-01.dev` if it calls the API directly from the browser.

### Admin service

- application type: Compose
- compose path: `infra/docker/admin-compose.yaml`
- environment variables (set in Dokploy's UI, not in the file):
  `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...`, `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com`,
  and optionally `VITE_AUTH_APP_URL` (defaults to `https://auth.unimatrix-01.dev`) — see
  "SPA build args now default in `deploy.config.ts`" above
- Domains page: route `admin.unimatrix-01.dev` to the `admin` service,
  container port `8080`

Access control is Cloudflare Access on the proxied hostname, not app code —
`curl https://admin.unimatrix-01.dev/` returns a 302 to
`unimatrix-01.cloudflareaccess.com`. That is what makes the scaffold's ungated
placeholder route safe; see `apps/admin/AGENTS.md`.

### Secrets service

- application type: Compose
- compose path: `infra/docker/secrets-compose.yaml`
- no Domains page entry — this service is deliberately unrouted, with no
  public hostname and no container port exposed through Traefik
- required environment variables (set in Dokploy's UI, not in the file):
  `SECRETS_KEKS` (see `packages/secrets/AGENTS.md` for its format; there is no
  default, so a missing value fails the service at startup rather than
  silently sealing values under a placeholder key), plus
  `SECRETS_TLS_CERT_BASE64` and `SECRETS_TLS_KEY_BASE64` — see "Shared network
  and TLS" below

**Persistent storage:** `secrets-compose.yaml` declares a `secrets-data`
volume mounted at `/data` (where the DB defaults to `/data/secrets.sqlite`)
and sets `DB_MIGRATE_ON_START=true`, so pending migrations are applied against
that volume automatically at container startup. As with the API service,
confirm the volume is mapped to persistent host storage (Advanced → Volumes)
so it survives redeploys.

**Issuing a service token:** every request except `GET /health` carries a
bearer token, and tokens are minted by a CLI inside the running container
rather than over HTTP. It needs the database but not `SECRETS_KEKS`.

```bash
docker exec <container> node dist/cli/service-token.js \
  issue --name api --scope github --capability read
```

The plaintext prints once and only its digest is stored, so a lost token is
reissued rather than recovered. `list` and `revoke --name <name>` are the other
two subcommands, and both they and `issue` append a row to the audit log.

**Rotating the KEK:** two more host-local CLIs, `dist/cli/kek.js` and
`dist/cli/secret.js`, sit beside `service-token.js`. Neither takes a
`--kek` flag — `docker exec` already inherits `SECRETS_KEKS`. The ordered
runbook:

1. Capture the current key before touching anything, encrypted offline:

   ```bash
   set -o pipefail
   docker exec <container> sh -c 'test -n "${SECRETS_KEKS:-}" && printf %s "$SECRETS_KEKS"' \
     | gpg -c --armor --output kek-<date>.asc
   ```

   Or read it from Dokploy's environment-variable UI where it was pasted. The pipe keeps the key
   out of the argument list and shell history; restore with `gpg -d kek-<date>.asc`.

   **`set -o pipefail` and the `test -n` are what make this fail loudly.** Without them a failed
   `docker exec` — wrong container name, container not running — still runs `gpg`, which encrypts
   empty input and writes a well-formed `.asc` file containing nothing. It decrypts cleanly to an
   empty string, so nothing about the artifact says it is not a backup. Confirm the file is
   non-trivial in size and prove the restore opens every row (`kek verify` under the restored key)
   before treating it as one.

   Do this regardless of whether anything looks wrong — a backup taken after a key is already lost
   is not a backup, and one that has never been restored is a hypothesis rather than a backup.
2. `docker exec <container> node dist/cli/kek.js generate` and encrypt the
   printed `<version>:<key>` entry offline the same way — call this new version `<n>`. It
   prints only the new entry, never the rest of the ring. `SECRETS_KEKS` set
   but unparsable (the state a broken volume can leave it in) does not block
   this step: `generate` says so on stderr and still prints a usable entry.
3. In Dokploy's environment-variable UI, prepend the new entry to
   `SECRETS_KEKS` (new entry first, comma-separated), keeping the old entry,
   and redeploy. **Wait for the container to be recreated before step 4** — the
   deploy is queued rather than applied, and the old ring stays live for minutes
   afterwards; see "A deploy is queued, not applied" below.
4. `docker exec <container> node dist/cli/kek.js rotate --to-version <n>` —
   re-seals every `secret_versions` row, live and superseded, under version
   `<n>`. Refuses to start if `<n>` is not the ring's actual active version
   (the redeploy in step 3 has not taken effect in this container) or if any
   row's KEK version is missing from the ring, and is resumable if
   interrupted.
5. `docker exec <container> node dist/cli/kek.js verify --expect-active <n>`
   — must report zero rows outside version `<n>` before the next step, and
   likewise refuses outright if `<n>` is not the ring's actual active
   version. It censuses every row from the envelope's own KEK version field,
   not the `kek_version` column, because `SecretsKeyring#open` resolves the
   key the same way; a census built from the column could read "nothing left
   on the old key" while envelopes are still sealed under it.
6. Only once `verify` reports zero rows outside the active version, remove
   the old entry from `SECRETS_KEKS` and redeploy again.

**Recovering a volume when the service will not boot:** run the CLI directly
against the volume from outside the running container. Export
`SECRETS_KEKS` in the invoking shell first — `-e SECRETS_KEKS` with no `=`
forwards that shell variable into the container without ever putting the key
in argv — and pass the image tag Dokploy built for this service (visible in
its Dokploy UI or `docker images`):

```bash
export SECRETS_KEKS=...
docker run --rm -e SECRETS_KEKS -v <project>_secrets-data:/data \
  <image> node dist/cli/kek.js verify --expect-active <n>
```

The volume name is prefixed with the Dokploy project name by Compose — read
the actual name from `docker volume ls` rather than copying `secrets-data`
from `secrets-compose.yaml` directly.

**Shared network and TLS.** This stack and the API stack both join one
external Docker network, `unimatrix-secrets`, and the store serves HTTPS on it
with a self-signed certificate the API pins by value. The network is what puts
the store within reach of another stack at all; the pin is what stops three
long-lived bearer tokens crossing it in cleartext.

The store still has no Domains entry and stays off `dokploy-network`, where
every container is one Traefik serves. Network position was never the boundary
in either direction: every request but `GET /health` is rejected without a
valid service token.

Generate the certificate on the host, once. Not in the image — the private key
would land in a registry layer. Not at boot — it would change on every restart
and the API's pinned copy would be stale within minutes.

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem \
  -days 3650 -subj "/CN=secrets" -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:secrets"
base64 -w0 cert.pem   # -> SECRETS_TLS_CERT_BASE64 (both stacks)
base64 -w0 key.pem    # -> SECRETS_TLS_KEY_BASE64 (this stack only)
```

The SAN must be `secrets`, the store's Compose service name, because that is
the host the API connects to and hostname verification stays on. Ten years is
deliberate: a certificate pinned by value gains nothing from expiring, and an
expired one is an outage with a confusing error.

Order matters, and none of these steps is optional. Steps 1 to 3 happen
**before the compose changes reach `main`**, not after. Both services carry
`autoDeploy: true` on `main` with their own compose file in `watchPaths` (read
from Dokploy's `compose.one`), so the merge is the deploy — and an unset
variable reaches the container as an empty string, present rather than absent,
which both loaders refuse. Merging first restart-loops the store and the API,
and with the store down step 3's tokens cannot be minted at all: the CLI that
mints them runs inside the running container.

Setting the variables early is safe. The deployed compose files do not
reference them until the change lands.

1. `docker network create unimatrix-secrets` on the host. Compose does not
   create an external network; it fails when one is missing.
2. Generate the certificate as above and set `SECRETS_TLS_CERT_BASE64` and
   `SECRETS_TLS_KEY_BASE64` on the **secrets** stack.
3. Mint the three service tokens against the still-running store, then set all
   five `SECRETS_*` variables on the **api** stack: the base URL
   `https://secrets:3001`, the three distinct tokens, and the certificate.
   Never the private key.
4. Merge. Both stacks deploy on their own compose file changing, and a deploy
   is queued rather than applied — see "A deploy is queued, not applied" below.
5. Confirm `"scheme":"https"` in the store's boot log and the container
   reporting `healthy`, then check the public API through Traefik immediately.
   A 502 means the explicit `networks:` block cost the service its Traefik
   attachment.

**Telling a misconfigured token from a missing secret.** The store answers a
wrong-capability caller, an out-of-scope name and an absent name with a
byte-identical 404, so the admin console cannot distinguish them and neither
can a log line. What does distinguish them:

1. A 401 is unambiguous — an invalid or revoked token. Everything else is a
   404.
2. `/secrets/admin` answering 404 rather than 401 when unauthenticated means
   the module never registered, so the store's base URL or one of its three
   scoped tokens is missing. A missing certificate is not this symptom: with an
   `https://` base URL the API refuses to boot at all rather than serving
   without the module.
3. Every row reading "Not set" while the store holds values means a manage
   token scoped to the wrong tier.
4. Authoritative, and host-local:
   `docker exec <secrets> node dist/cli/service-token.js list` prints each
   token's scope and capability, and `secret_audit_log` holds a row per read
   attempt.
5. As a positive control, create a throwaway credential in each tier from the
   console.

## Traefik expectations

Traefik is the public edge proxy in Dokploy, and Dokploy's Domains page is the
source of truth for routing — it configures Traefik itself once you point a
service at a hostname and container port there. The repo does not ship
Traefik labels or a Traefik stack, and the compose files intentionally leave
Traefik config out for this reason.

Production routing still needs to satisfy:

- the public site hostname routes to the web service
- the API hostname routes to the API service
- the `cflop.unimatrix-01.dev` hostname routes to the cflop service
- the `cube.unimatrix-01.dev` hostname 301s to `cflop.unimatrix-01.dev` via a
  Traefik middleware, and still terminates TLS so the redirect is reachable
- the `auth.unimatrix-01.dev` hostname routes to the auth service
- the `admin.unimatrix-01.dev` hostname routes to the admin service
- TLS terminates at Traefik
- standard proxy headers are forwarded so the API can run with
  `TRUST_PROXY=1`

Because separate-origin is the default deployment shape, Traefik does not need
to rewrite `/api` paths in the primary production setup.

## Web configuration

- `apps/web/.env.production.example` shows the checked-in separate-origin
  example: `https://api.unimatrix-01.dev`
- same-origin deployments can keep the default relative `/api` value, but that
  path is secondary to the separate-origin deployment described here

## Clerk setup

Clerk is a single shared application across every Unimatrix service, with
primary domain `unimatrix-01.dev`. Sessions are shared across all subdomains
(`auth.`, `api.`, `cflop.`, and the apex), so **no satellite domains are
needed**.

A human needs to do the following once in the Clerk Dashboard:

1. Under **Configure → Sessions → "Customize session token"**, add a claim
   `"permissions": "{{user.public_metadata.permissions}}"` so the API can
   verify permissions networklessly from the session token.
2. Set the backend env (`CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`,
   `CLERK_JWT_KEY`) on the API service, and the frontend env
   (`VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`) on the auth and admin services. The web
   service carries no Clerk key — it is a fully anonymous public site.
3. Bootstrap the first platform administrator by setting that user's
   `publicMetadata` to `{ "permissions": { "auth": ["admin"] } }` directly in
   the Dashboard — there is no public "become admin" flow.

See `packages/auth/README.md` for the exact steps and the full permission
scheme.

## API configuration

- Start the compiled runtime with `node apps/api/dist/server.js`
- `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` accepts a comma-separated list of exact origins such
  as `https://site.example.com` and wildcard subdomain origins such as
  `https://*.example.com`
- wildcard rules match subdomains only; they do not match the apex domain, so
  the apex must also be listed explicitly
- if `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is unset, the API falls back to
  `DEFAULT_API_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `apps/api/src/config.ts`, which includes
  local development origins — set it explicitly in production

## Auto-updates from `main`

Enable automatic Dokploy redeploys from the repository `main` branch for every
service, using service-specific watch paths. This avoids rebuilding every
service for an unrelated monorepo change while still rebuilding when its image
inputs change.

Each live app owns the canonical list for its Dokploy service:

- `apps/web/README.md`
- `apps/api/README.md`
- `apps/cflop/README.md`
- `apps/auth/README.md`
- `apps/admin/README.md`
- `apps/secrets/README.md`

Copy each list exactly into that service's Dokploy watch-path configuration.
The lists include the app directory, directly imported workspace packages,
shared root pnpm manifests, and the service-specific Compose file. When an app
adds a workspace dependency, new bundled content, or another Docker build
input, update its README and Dokploy configuration in the same change.

## The host reuses its layer cache between deploys

The prune stage's `COPY . .` misses on every deploy — each deploy builds a
different commit and the whole repository is that stage's context. The install
layer survives it anyway, because `turbo prune <package> --docker` emits an
`out/json` that a change outside the package's pruned scope does not move.

Measured on the `api` service across two consecutive deploys, 2026-08-14: b169a72
at 07:17:43 UTC, then 96c4397 at 07:33:17 UTC — a change spanning `apps/cflop`, a
new `packages/cube`, and the root `pnpm-lock.yaml`. Running
`turbo prune @unimatrix/api --docker` at both commits and diffing gives a
byte-identical `out/json`, and the second build reported:

```text
#14 [build 1/5] COPY --from=prune /workspace/out/json/ .
#14 CACHED
#15 [build 2/5] RUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
#15 CACHED
#17 [build 4/5] RUN pnpm --filter "@unimatrix/api..." build
#17 DONE 10.5s
```

The cache is shared across services rather than held per service: the `web`
compose deploy at 07:17:17 reused an install layer that a `main` deploy of the
`web-preview` Application service had built 78 seconds earlier. That is an
ordinary branch deploy — PR previews still produce nothing, see "Pull request
preview deployments" below.

It is not durable, though. The host carries no `/etc/docker/daemon.json`, so
BuildKit's default garbage collection applies: read on 2026-08-14 at 07:37 UTC,
the oldest surviving cache record was under three hours old. Treat a layer from a
previous day as gone.

Read the install step off the host per deploy:

```bash
f=$(ls -t /etc/dokploy/logs/<service>/* | head -1)
awk '/RUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile/ { id = $1 }
     id && $1 == id && ($2 == "CACHED" || $2 == "DONE") { print; exit }' "$f"
```

A `grep -B1 … | grep -A1 'pnpm install'` pipeline looks equivalent and fails
silently: on a cache miss BuildKit prints progress lines between the step header
and its `DONE`, so it matches nothing and prints the same empty output as a
mistyped service name.

**The saving is seconds.** On `api` the install step is about 10s (`#15 DONE 9.4s`
on the 07:17:43 build) against a whole-image build of 35-47s, and
`pnpm --filter "@unimatrix/api..." build` plus `pnpm --prod deploy` take most of
what is left. Those two totals come from a hand-run `docker build` pair on the host
at b169a72, outside Dokploy, differing by one appended line in
`apps/api/src/server.ts`. On `web` the install step is 13.4s and the image has no
`--prod deploy` stage at all — it hands its `dist/` to nginx.

## A deploy is queued, not applied

A Dokploy deploy is queued rather than applied, however it was triggered. Over
the API, `POST /api/compose.deploy` answers
`200 {"success":true,"message":"Deployment queued"}` and nothing in that response
says when the new configuration takes effect; a redeploy clicked in the UI gives
no completion signal at all. Measured on the `secrets` compose service on
2026-08-10: the container kept its previous environment for roughly seven minutes
after the 200, while `docker ps` reported it `Up N minutes (healthy)` throughout.
That is one observation rather than a bound — treat the lag as minutes of
unpredictable length, not as a figure to code a timeout against.

The signal that a deploy landed is that the container was **recreated**:

```bash
docker ps --filter name=<service> --format '{{.CreatedAt}}'
```

Read it before the deploy and again after; the value changing tells you a deploy
landed, though not which configuration it carried. A restart does not move it, so
a crash loop cannot fake the signal. An empty result means the container is
between the old one and the new one — `docker ps` lists running containers only —
and looks identical to a mistyped service name, so confirm the filter matches
before the deploy rather than after.

A 200 is not the signal, and neither is a healthy status: the old container goes
on reporting healthy while it runs the configuration you believe you replaced.

This binds on any runbook that edits an environment variable in Dokploy and then
acts on the new value. The KEK rotation runbook under "Secrets service" above is
the worst case, because acting inside the window re-seals rows under the very key
that is about to be retired, and then deletes the key still holding them. Its
steps 4 and 5 refuse outright when the ring is not the one they were told to
expect, which closes that particular hole — but the guard lives in those two
CLIs, while the lag belongs to Dokploy and reaches everything else that redeploys
to change a value.

## Pull request preview deployments

Previews are entirely Dokploy-side. **Nothing in this repository is required**
— no workflow, no secret, no token, no permission change. The Dokploy GitHub
App's installation token drives the webhook, the build, the PR comment, and
the teardown.

The setting defaults below were verified on 2026-07-27 against
`packages/server/src/db/schema/application.ts` on Dokploy `canary`, against
Dokploy issue #2028 for the Compose limitation (open, unassigned, no linked PR,
opened 2025-06-11), and then against the live instance: creating an application
over the API returns `previewPort: 3000`, `previewHttps: false`,
`previewCertificateType: "none"`, `previewLimit: 3`, and
`isPreviewDeploymentsActive: false` on the fresh record.

The `web-preview` and `cflop-preview` services live in the `Unimatrix-01`
project's `production` environment, configured as below. Their settings live in
Dokploy's database rather than in this repo, so this document describes intent —
read the instance, not this file, when the two disagree.

### Previews need Application services, not the existing Compose apps

The `infra/docker/*-compose.yaml` files run as Dokploy **Compose** apps,
and Dokploy has no preview support for that service type: all thirteen
`preview*` columns live on `applications`, and `compose` has none of them.
This is not a configuration gap that can be filled in — the fields do not
exist on the record.

So a previewable app needs a **second** Dokploy service alongside its
production Compose app, of type Application, reusing the same Dockerfile
unchanged:

- Build type: `Dockerfile`
- Dockerfile path: `apps/web/Dockerfile` / `apps/cflop/Dockerfile`
- Docker context path: `.` — the repo root, matching the build rule in
  `infra/docker/README.md`
- Preview port: **8080**

### Settings whose defaults are wrong for this repo

Defaults quoted verbatim from the schema (see the verification note above).

| Setting | Dokploy default | Needs to be | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `previewPort` | `.default(3000)` | `8080` | Both previewable images serve on 8080 (`listen 8080` in every `apps/*/nginx.conf`). Leaving the default produces a domain that resolves and then dead-ends. |
| `previewHttps` | `.notNull().default(false)` | `true` | An `http://` preview origin is rejected by the API's CORS rule — every entry in `DEFAULT_API_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (`apps/api/src/config.ts`) is scheme-qualified `https://` for the public domains. With HTTPS on, the existing `https://*.unimatrix-01.dev` entry already matches preview hosts, so no repo change is needed. |
| `previewCertificateType` | `.notNull().default("none")` | issue certs | TLS is not automatic. Needs either per-host Let's Encrypt or a wildcard cert covering the preview domain. |
| `isPreviewDeploymentsActive` | `.default(false)` | `true` | Off until switched on per application. |
| `previewRequireCollaboratorPermissions` | `.default(true)` | leave `true` | The public-repo guard. See "Fork PRs" below. |

`apps/auth/src/features/auth/safe-redirect.ts` also requires
`protocol === "https:"` for any `unimatrix-01.dev` host, but that is the auth
app, which is deliberately not previewed — it is not what forces `previewHttps`
here. The CORS rule is.

### The preview domain is a prerequisite, not polish

Dokploy's default preview domain is an auto-generated `*.traefik.me` host. For
`apps/web` that is not a cosmetic choice: a `.traefik.me` origin matches no
entry in `DEFAULT_API_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, so the preview loads and then
fails every API call. A half-working preview is worse than a broken one.

Set `previewWildcard` to a wildcard under `unimatrix-01.dev` (e.g.
`*.preview.unimatrix-01.dev`) and point a wildcard `A`/`CNAME` record at the
Dokploy server before enabling previews. `apps/cflop` would survive the
default (no API dependency), but there is no reason to split them.

### Three behaviours that are invisible from the UI

- **Watch paths do not apply to pull requests.** The `push` handler filters by
  watch path; the `pull_request` handler does not. Every PR against `main`
  rebuilds every previewable app — a docs-only PR triggers two full repo-root
  `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` plus workspace builds and posts two bot
  comments. If that is too much load, the throttle is the preview **label**
  gate. Note its sharp edge: labels gate creation and rebuild only. Removing
  the label does **not** tear an existing preview down, so it is not a kill
  switch.
- **`previewLimit` (default 3) fails silently.** Exceeding it skips the
  deployment with no PR comment and no error, so a missing preview is not
  evidence that something broke.
- **Web previews run the new frontend against the *production* API.** Only web
  and cflop are previewed, and web's preview build arg points
  `VITE_API_BASE_URL` at the live API. A PR that changes both `apps/web` and
  `apps/api` therefore previews the new UI against the old backend: a contract
  change can look broken in preview when it is fine, and — the dangerous
  direction — can look fine when it is not.

Preview target-branch matching uses `pull_request.base.ref`, so only PRs
targeting `main` produce previews. Teardown is automatic on PR `closed`, which
covers merges.

### Fork PRs

Two independent barriers, which matters because this repo is public:

1. `previewRequireCollaboratorPermissions` defaults to `true`, so only
   write/maintain/admin actors pass.
2. The clone runs `git clone --branch <pull_request.head.ref>` against the
   **base** repo, where a fork's head branch does not exist — so a fork
   preview would fail at clone even with the gate disabled.

Dokploy's own documentation still recommends against preview deployments on
public repositories, on the grounds that external contributors can trigger
builds on your server. The gate above is what makes that recommendation
survivable here, so do not disable it.

### Which apps to preview

- **`apps/cflop`** — the clean case. No build args, no backend, no env;
  progress lives in `localStorage`.
- **`apps/web`** — point previews at the production API. The site carries no
  Clerk key at all, so every preview is anonymous by construction.
- **`apps/auth`** — **do not preview.** Not for secret exposure:
  `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is public by design and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
  never enters the auth image (it is API-only). The real reason is that
  previewing auth means adding ephemeral hostnames to the production Clerk
  instance's allowed origins and redirect URLs — and any HTTPS preview host
  under `unimatrix-01.dev` then becomes a valid post-authentication redirect
  target for real user sessions.

### What to click in Dokploy

1. Install the Dokploy GitHub App on the `unimatrixcore` org and grant it
   access to `unimatrix-01`.
2. Create a new **Application** service for `apps/web` (alongside, not
   replacing, the existing Compose app). Set build type Dockerfile, Dockerfile
   path `apps/web/Dockerfile`, context path `.`.
3. Repeat for `apps/cflop` with `apps/cflop/Dockerfile`.
4. On each, open Preview Settings and enable preview deployments.
5. Set Preview Port to `8080` on both — the default of 3000 is wrong here.
6. Enable Preview HTTPS and choose a certificate type. This is required, not
   cosmetic: an `http://` preview origin fails the API's CORS check.
7. Set the preview wildcard domain, and confirm DNS resolves it to the server
   (a wildcard `A`/`CNAME` under `unimatrix-01.dev`).
8. Leave "require collaborator permissions" enabled.
9. Set `previewLimit` deliberately — the default of 3 skips silently once
   exceeded.
10. For `apps/web`, set preview build args to the production
    `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.
11. Optionally add a `preview` label gate if per-PR build load is a problem.

### Doing it over the API instead of the UI

Every *Dokploy-side* step above is reachable through its REST API, so the
service creation and preview configuration can be scripted or handed to an
agent rather than clicked — that is how the current services were created. The
two prerequisites that live outside Dokploy are not scriptable with a key; see
below. Generate a key under Settings -> Profile (API/CLI section); it is sent
as an `x-api-key` header.

Two things that cost time when scripting it:

- **`/api/openapi.json` returns 404 on this instance.** Swagger is restricted to
  authenticated administrators by default, so the machine-readable field list is
  not available to a key alone. Discover shapes from validation errors instead —
  a `400` returns a `zodError.fieldErrors` map naming exactly what is missing.
- **`application.saveBuildType` requires `herokuVersion` and `railpackVersion`**
  even for a Dockerfile build. They are non-optional but nullable, so pass
  `null`. Omitting them fails with
  `"expected nonoptional, received undefined"`.

The relevant endpoints are `POST /api/application.create` (needs `name` and
`environmentId` — read the latter from `project.all`),
`POST /api/application.saveGithubProvider`, `POST /api/application.saveBuildType`,
`POST /api/application.update`, and `POST /api/application.deploy`. Every
preview column is writable through `application.update`:
`isPreviewDeploymentsActive`, `previewPort`, `previewHttps`, `previewWildcard`,
`previewLimit`, `previewCertificateType` (`"letsencrypt" | "none" | "custom"`),
`previewRequireCollaboratorPermissions`, `previewBuildArgs`, plus `previewEnv`,
`previewBuildSecrets`, `previewLabels`, `previewPath`, and
`previewCustomCertResolver`.

Two things this does not remove: installing the GitHub App is an OAuth consent
flow that cannot be done with the key, and the wildcard DNS record lives at the
registrar.

Treat the key accordingly. It is a bearer credential with no scoping and no
expiry, granting instance-wide administrative control: it can create, mutate,
and delete every application on the Dokploy instance — not only this project's
— and trigger builds. Since a build runs a Dockerfile of the holder's choosing
on the host, treat that reach as host-level in practice even though the key
itself is not an OS credential. Issue one for the task, keep it out of the repo
and out of CI, and revoke it when the setup is done.

## Verification after deploy

Verify these URLs after each production rollout:

- `https://site.example.com/`
- `https://site.example.com/about`
- `https://site.example.com/blog`
- `https://site.example.com/projects`
- `https://api.example.com/health`
- `https://cflop.unimatrix-01.dev/`
- `https://cflop.unimatrix-01.dev/learn`
- `https://cflop.unimatrix-01.dev/drill`
- `https://cube.unimatrix-01.dev/learn` — must 301 to
  `https://cflop.unimatrix-01.dev/learn`, preserving the path
- `https://auth.unimatrix-01.dev/`
- `https://auth.unimatrix-01.dev/sign-in`
- `https://auth.unimatrix-01.dev/account`

Also verify that refreshing a deep route on the public site, cflop, or
the auth app still renders the SPA instead of returning a proxy or
static-host 404.

## Troubleshooting

- **`Nixpacks build failed` / `Failed to read app source directory / Not a directory`**:
  the Dokploy service was created as the default **Application** type, which
  auto-detects a builder (Nixpacks) and cannot build this pnpm monorepo. Every
  service here must be a **Compose** application pointing at its
  `infra/docker/*-compose.yaml` file (see the per-service sections above), which
  builds the app's `Dockerfile` with the repo root as the build context. Recreate
  the service as a Compose application rather than editing the Nixpacks one.
- **Build args resolve to empty** (e.g. a blank `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` or
  `VITE_API_BASE_URL` baked into the bundle): the compose files pass these through
  as `${VAR}` build args, so they must be set in the Dokploy service's environment
  before the build runs — Vite inlines them at build time, not runtime.
