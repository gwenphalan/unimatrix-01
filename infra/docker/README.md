# Docker and Compose

This directory documents the repo-owned container workflow for the current live
surface:

- `apps/web` as a static Vite SPA image
- `apps/api` as a Fastify Node runtime image
- `apps/cube-trainer` as a static Vite SPA image
- `apps/auth` as a static Vite SPA image
- `apps/admin` as a static Vite SPA image

Dokploy plus Traefik is the primary production target for now. The Docker and
Compose files here are the secondary, manual deployment path and the local
validation path for containerized builds.

## Monorepo build rules

Build all five images from the repo root, not from an individual app
directory.

That is required because:

- `apps/web` resolves workspace source aliases from `apps/web/vite.config.ts`
  and `apps/web/tsconfig.json`
- `apps/web` imports public markdown directly from `content/`
- `apps/api` depends on `@unimatrix/shared`, and the compiled API still imports
  that package by workspace name at runtime
- `apps/cube-trainer` resolves its `@unimatrix/ui` workspace source alias from
  `apps/cube-trainer/vite.config.ts` and `apps/cube-trainer/tsconfig.json`
- `apps/auth` resolves its `@unimatrix/auth`, `@unimatrix/api-client`,
  `@unimatrix/shared`, and `@unimatrix/ui` workspace source aliases from
  `apps/auth/vite.config.ts` and `apps/auth/tsconfig.json`
- `apps/admin` resolves its `@unimatrix/auth`, `@unimatrix/chrome`, and
  `@unimatrix/ui` workspace source aliases from `apps/admin/vite.config.ts`
  and `apps/admin/tsconfig.json`

The checked-in images assume these repo-root build contexts:

```bash
docker build -f apps/web/Dockerfile .
docker build -f apps/api/Dockerfile .
docker build -f apps/cube-trainer/Dockerfile .
docker build -f apps/auth/Dockerfile .
docker build -f apps/admin/Dockerfile .
```

## Dokploy watch-path convention

Dokploy services should watch only the repository paths that can affect their
image, rather than rebuilding every service for every `main` branch change.
Each live app README is the canonical service-specific list:

- `apps/web/README.md`
- `apps/api/README.md`
- `apps/cube-trainer/README.md`
- `apps/auth/README.md`
- `apps/admin/README.md`

Every list includes the service directory, workspace source imported by its
build, root pnpm manifests, `.dockerignore`, and the service-specific Compose
file. Update the list and the matching Dokploy watch-path configuration when a
Docker build gains a workspace dependency or another repository input.

## Web image

The web image builds `apps/web/dist` and serves it from a small internal Nginx
container. Nginx is only the static file server inside the container. It is not
the public edge proxy; Traefik stays the edge router in Dokploy.

### Web build inputs

See [`apps/web/README.md`](../../apps/web/README.md) for the canonical,
up-to-date list of build inputs and Dokploy watch paths.

### Web runtime contract

- container port: `8080`
- build artifact: `apps/web/dist`
- required SPA fallback: unknown application routes must serve `index.html`
- build-time env: `VITE_API_BASE_URL`; optional `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
  (enables the header sign-in affordance) and `VITE_AUTH_APP_URL` (sign-in link
  target, defaults to `https://auth.unimatrix-01.dev`)

These `VITE_*` values are compiled into the frontend bundle. Change them at
image build time, not after the container starts — in particular, setting
`VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` only in the runtime env will not enable the
sign-in button, because the bundle already baked in whether auth is on.

Example build:

```bash
docker build \
  -f apps/web/Dockerfile \
  --build-arg VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001 \
  -t unimatrix-web:local \
  .
```

## API image

The API image builds `@unimatrix/shared`, compiles `apps/api`, then uses
`pnpm deploy` to package the runtime with production dependencies.

### API build inputs

See [`apps/api/README.md`](../../apps/api/README.md) for the canonical,
up-to-date list of build inputs and Dokploy watch paths.

### API runtime contract

- entrypoint: `node dist/server.js`
- container port: `3001`
- healthcheck path: `/health`
- required runtime env:
  - `HOST`
  - `PORT`
  - `NODE_ENV`
  - `LOG_LEVEL`
  - `TRUST_PROXY`
  - `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`

The image defaults `HOST=0.0.0.0`, `PORT=3001`, and `NODE_ENV=production`.
Optional runtime env: `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` (per-request file upload size limit
for the user-data file endpoints; defaults to 5 MiB),
`MAX_USER_STORAGE_BYTES` (cumulative per-user cap across documents and files
together; defaults to 50 MiB), plus the Clerk
variables (`CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `CLERK_JWT_KEY`),
required together in production.

Example build:

```bash
docker build -f apps/api/Dockerfile -t unimatrix-api:local .
```

Example run:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 3001:3001 \
  -e CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:8080 \
  unimatrix-api:local
```

## Cube Trainer image

The cube-trainer image builds `apps/cube-trainer/dist` and serves it from a
small internal Nginx container, same pattern as the web image. It has no
backend dependency: algorithm data is bundled at build time and per-case
learning progress lives in the browser's `localStorage`, so there is no
build-time or runtime env to configure.

### Cube Trainer build inputs

See [`apps/cube-trainer/README.md`](../../apps/cube-trainer/README.md) for the
canonical, up-to-date list of build inputs and Dokploy watch paths.

### Cube Trainer runtime contract

- container port: `8080`
- build artifact: `apps/cube-trainer/dist`
- required SPA fallback: unknown application routes must serve `index.html`
- no build-time or runtime env required

Example build:

```bash
docker build \
  -f apps/cube-trainer/Dockerfile \
  -t unimatrix-cube-trainer:local \
  .
```

## Auth image

The auth image builds `apps/auth/dist` and serves it from a small internal
Nginx container, same pattern as the web and cube-trainer images. It is the
central Clerk-backed accounts app (sign-in/sign-up and account management).

### Auth build inputs

See [`apps/auth/README.md`](../../apps/auth/README.md) for the canonical,
up-to-date list of build inputs and Dokploy watch paths.

### Auth runtime contract

- container port: `8080`
- build artifact: `apps/auth/dist`
- required SPA fallback: unknown application routes must serve `index.html`
- build-time env: `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

Both `VITE_API_BASE_URL` and `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` are compiled into the
frontend bundle. `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is a public key (safe to ship in
a browser bundle), but it still must be set at build time to the real key for
the target Clerk instance, since Vite inlines `import.meta.env.VITE_*` values
at build time, not at container start.

Example build:

```bash
docker build \
  -f apps/auth/Dockerfile \
  --build-arg VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001 \
  --build-arg VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxx \
  -t unimatrix-auth:local \
  .
```

## Admin image

The admin image builds `apps/admin/dist` and serves it from a small internal
Nginx container, same pattern as the other SPA images. It is the operator
console behind Cloudflare Access; the container itself carries no secrets.

### Admin build inputs

See [`apps/admin/README.md`](../../apps/admin/README.md) for the canonical,
up-to-date list of build inputs and Dokploy watch paths.

### Admin runtime contract

- container port: `8080`
- build artifact: `apps/admin/dist`
- required SPA fallback: unknown application routes must serve `index.html`
- build-time env: `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`; optional
  `VITE_AUTH_APP_URL` (sign-in redirect target, defaults to
  `https://auth.unimatrix-01.dev`)

`VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` has no Dockerfile default on purpose:
`loadAdminAppRuntimeConfig` throws without it, so an image built without the
key fails loudly in the browser rather than rendering an admin console that
can never sign anyone in. All `VITE_*` values are inlined at build time, not
container start.

Example build:

```bash
docker build \
  -f apps/admin/Dockerfile \
  --build-arg VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001 \
  --build-arg VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxx \
  -t unimatrix-admin:local \
  .
```

## Compose workflow

`infra/docker/web-compose.yaml`, `infra/docker/api-compose.yaml`,
`infra/docker/cube-trainer-compose.yaml`, `infra/docker/auth-compose.yaml`,
and `infra/docker/admin-compose.yaml` are each single-service files. Run them together from the repo root for local
combined validation:

```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001 \
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxx \
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:8080,http://127.0.0.1:8080 \
docker compose \
  -f infra/docker/api-compose.yaml \
  -f infra/docker/web-compose.yaml \
  -f infra/docker/cube-trainer-compose.yaml \
  -f infra/docker/auth-compose.yaml \
  -f infra/docker/admin-compose.yaml \
  up --build
```

None of the files publish host ports. That is intentional: the same files run
unmodified as Dokploy Compose apps, where Dokploy's Domains page owns port
exposure instead of a `ports:` block. Because of that, `curl`/browser checks
against `localhost` need containers run directly instead of through compose:

```bash
docker build -f apps/api/Dockerfile -t unimatrix-api:local .
docker run --rm -p 3001:3001 -e CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:8080 unimatrix-api:local

docker build -f apps/web/Dockerfile --build-arg VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001 -t unimatrix-web:local .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 unimatrix-web:local

docker build -f apps/cube-trainer/Dockerfile -t unimatrix-cube-trainer:local .
docker run --rm -p 8081:8080 unimatrix-cube-trainer:local

docker build -f apps/auth/Dockerfile --build-arg VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001 --build-arg VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxx -t unimatrix-auth:local .
docker run --rm -p 8082:8080 unimatrix-auth:local

docker build -f apps/admin/Dockerfile --build-arg VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001 --build-arg VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxx -t unimatrix-admin:local .
docker run --rm -p 8083:8080 unimatrix-admin:local
```

To stop the compose stack:

```bash
docker compose \
  -f infra/docker/api-compose.yaml \
  -f infra/docker/web-compose.yaml \
  -f infra/docker/cube-trainer-compose.yaml \
  -f infra/docker/auth-compose.yaml \
  -f infra/docker/admin-compose.yaml \
  down
```

## Verification

After startup, verify:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health
curl -I http://localhost:8080/
curl -I http://localhost:8081/
curl -I http://localhost:8082/
curl -I http://localhost:8083/
```

Then open these web routes in a browser and confirm they render after both a
normal navigation and a refresh:

- `/`
- `/about`
- `/blog`
- `/projects`

And these cube-trainer routes:

- `/`
- `/learn`
- `/drill`

And these auth app routes:

- `/`
- `/sign-in`
- `/account`

## Current database posture

`apps/api` depends on `@unimatrix/db` for the user-data module (per-user
settings and files), so the API is not database-free. The container workflow
persists that data:

- **SQLite volume**: the API Dockerfile defaults `DATABASE_URL` to
  `/data/unimatrix.sqlite` and creates `/data` owned by the non-root `node`
  user; `api-compose.yaml` mounts a named `api-data` volume there, so data
  survives container recreation once the volume is mapped to durable host
  storage.
- **Migrations**: `api-compose.yaml` sets `DB_MIGRATE_ON_START=true`, so the
  API applies any pending Drizzle migrations against the volume at startup
  (idempotent — a no-op when the schema is current). No separate migration
  service or one-off command is required in this workflow.

Remaining caveat: SQLite is single-writer, so this shape assumes a single API
instance. Horizontal scaling would need a different database or a shared
storage strategy — document that here if it is ever adopted.

## Dokploy Compose deployment

`infra/docker/web-compose.yaml`, `infra/docker/api-compose.yaml`,
`infra/docker/cube-trainer-compose.yaml`, `infra/docker/auth-compose.yaml`,
and `infra/docker/admin-compose.yaml` are single-service compose files meant to be used as Dokploy's "Compose"
application type, one Dokploy app per file. They intentionally have:

- no `ports:` host publishing
- no Traefik labels

Dokploy's own Domains page handles routing: pick the service and the
container port (`8080` for web, `3001` for api, `8080` for cube-trainer,
`8080` for auth, `8080` for admin) there, and Dokploy wires Traefik itself. Don't hand-add
Traefik labels to these files. Point the cube-trainer Dokploy app's domain at
`cube.unimatrix-01.dev`, the auth Dokploy app's domain at
`auth.unimatrix-01.dev`, and the admin Dokploy app's domain at
`admin.unimatrix-01.dev`.

`web-compose.yaml` and `api-compose.yaml` read their environment-dependent
values (`VITE_API_BASE_URL`, `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`) from compose variable
substitution, so set those in the Dokploy app's environment variables UI
rather than editing the file. `cube-trainer-compose.yaml` has no
environment-dependent values to set. `auth-compose.yaml` reads
`VITE_API_BASE_URL` and `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` the same way, and
`admin-compose.yaml` reads those two plus an optional `VITE_AUTH_APP_URL`.

These five files are Dokploy **Compose** apps, and Dokploy has no preview
deployment support for that service type — every `preview*` field lives on its
`applications` record and none exist on `compose`. Previews are therefore
configured on *separate* Application-type services that reuse these same
Dockerfiles unchanged, rather than by turning something on here. Don't try to
enable previews on these apps; there is nothing to enable.

See `infra/deployment/README.md` for the full Dokploy service setup, including
the preview deployment section.

## Base image updates

Dependabot watches base images through the `docker` ecosystem, pointed at the
five `apps/*` directories — **not** at this one. The compose files here declare
no `image:` at all, only `build:` plus a Dockerfile path, and Dependabot's
`docker-compose` parser reads only `image:` (or an inline `dockerfile_inline`).
It never follows `build.dockerfile`, so a `docker-compose` block would scan
these files and find nothing. Don't add one.

Two consequences worth knowing before treating a quiet Dependabot as "nothing
to update":

- Only the `nginx:1.29-alpine` pins are tracked. Every
  `FROM node:${NODE_VERSION}-alpine` is invisible: Dependabot does no ARG
  interpolation and its tag regex cannot match a leading `$`. That is
  deliberate — the Node version stays owned by `.node-version` and CI's
  `node-version-file` rather than gaining a second, competing owner.
- Base-image PRs auto-merge on the same terms as any other minor/patch,
  because CI's required `Images` checks now build every `apps/*/Dockerfile`.
  The history of that decision lives in the comment in
  `.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml`.
