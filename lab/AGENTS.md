## 1. Overview

`lab` (package `@unimatrix/lab`) is the UX prototyping harness: a surface for designing UX before a feature is built — where a button goes, how a view is laid out — so that tuning does not happen inside a real app against real data. It is a personal design tool. **It is not a component gallery, not a documentation site, and not shared with anyone.**

It is the third top-level workspace entry, alongside `apps/*` and `packages/*`, because it must be a workspace member to import `@unimatrix/ui` and `@unimatrix/chrome`.

Building or promoting a prototype goes through the `lab-prototype` skill: this file holds the facts, the skill holds the order.

## 2. The defining constraint: local-dev only

`pnpm --filter @unimatrix/lab dev` and nothing else. **No `build` script, no Dockerfile, no compose file, no domain, no CI `Images` entry, and no route in any deployed app.** This is what makes the whole security question disappear: prototype code has no production surface to leak onto. If a change here creates a deploy artifact of any kind, it has misread what this workspace is.

Why not a `lab.unimatrix-01.dev` subdomain, since that was the obvious alternative: `docs/deployment.md` documents Clerk sessions as shared across **all** `*.unimatrix-01.dev` subdomains, and API CORS allows `https://*.unimatrix-01.dev`. A prototype served from such a subdomain would receive the admin's Clerk cookie *and* be an allowed CORS origin against the API — a credentialed path to admin routes from the least-reviewed code in the repo. A cross-origin iframe is not a boundary when the origins share a cookie parent.

## 3. Folder Structure

- `src/app`: `router.tsx` (hand-written, code-based routing — no `@tanstack/router-plugin`, no `routeTree.gen.ts`) and `lab-shell.tsx` (`ToolShell` from `@unimatrix/chrome/tool`, wired with the mock account control). The shell wraps the **index only** — a prototype gets the bare viewport.
- `src/routes`: `prototype-index.tsx` (the list) and `prototype-host.tsx` (renders one prototype and nothing else).
- `src/lib/prototype-registry.ts`: `import.meta.glob` discovery of `lab/prototypes/**/*.tsx`.
- `src/mocks`: the only data surface a prototype may use. See below.
- `prototypes/`: gitignored working-tree sketches — only `.gitkeep` and `README.md` are tracked. See `prototypes/README.md`.

## 4. Mocks

`src/mocks/` stands in for anything a prototype must not or cannot reach, so a signed-in admin view can be prototyped with **no Clerk keys, no API running and no database**:

- `api.ts` — `LabApiClient`, a structural stand-in for `@unimatrix/api-client`'s content surface. In-memory, mutable, reset by a reload.
- `user-data.ts` — `LabUserStore`, a structural stand-in for `@unimatrix/user-data`'s `UserStore`.
- `asset-upload.ts` — `LabAssetUploader`, a structural stand-in for `apps/admin/src/features/content/asset-upload.ts`, the CMS's own upload module rather than `LabApiClient` above: the real flow is two non-JSON, multipart routes that `@unimatrix/api-client` does not carry, so the admin app owns them directly. `uploadAsset` returns real metadata for a real `File` (SHA-256 hashed with `crypto.subtle`) but resolves the delivery URL to a `URL.createObjectURL` blob, because there is no API here to serve one back. `LAB_ASSET_ACCEPT` is a hand-kept copy of the API's `INLINE_SAFE_CONTENT_TYPES` allowlist. Two limits are load-bearing enough to read before reaching for it: a `blob:`/`data:` `assetUrl()` result renders in a plain `<img>` but is silently blank inside `PublicMarkdown`, whose sanitizer accepts only root-relative or `https?:` sources; and an upload here is invisible to `createLabApiClient().listAssets()` — two separate in-memory stores standing in for the one `contentAssetsTable` the real routes share.
- `session.tsx` — `LabSession` fixtures and `MockAccountControl`, standing in for a Clerk session and `<UserButton />`.
- `fixtures.ts` — the seed rows.
- `api-base-url.ts` — a hardcoded `http://localhost:3000`, asserted local at module load.

**Every mock is typed against the real contracts**, so a contract change breaks the mock at typecheck rather than letting a prototype validate against a fiction. Request/response and data shapes come from `@unimatrix/shared`; the permission shapes come from `@unimatrix/auth`'s `.` entry, which is where they live and which is framework-agnostic, dependency-free code.

`LabApiClient`, `LabUserStore` and `LabAssetUploader` are *structurally* copied rather than imported. `@unimatrix/api-client` and `@unimatrix/user-data` are not dependencies of this workspace and are lint errors here, because importing either would put a working, credential-taking transport one import away from every prototype. Local-only hosting removes the production-bundle risk but not that one: a prototype holding the real client with a base URL pointed at `https://api.unimatrix-01.dev` can mutate live content from a laptop. `LabAssetUploader` is copied for the same underlying reason as the other two, by a different route: it stands in for a module that lives inside `apps/admin`, and no app is a dependency of any workspace here.

Keep `LabUserStore` in step with `packages/user-data/src/types.ts` by hand. If that stops being a small, stable interface, the answer is a types-only entry point on that package — not a dependency here.

## 5. Conventions

- **Scripts are `dev`, `lint` and `typecheck` only.** No `test` (turbo would run it against a harness with no tests) and no `build` (nothing builds the lab, and a `build` script would put it in `pnpm verify`'s `turbo run build` for nothing).
- **`prototypes/` is excluded from lint, typecheck and prettier**, and included in the stylesheet's `@source` globs. A half-finished sketch must not be a failing check; a prototype with no Tailwind output would be useless.
- **`@unimatrix/ui` and `@unimatrix/shared` resolve to package *source*** through `vite.config.ts` aliases and `tsconfig.json` paths — the same wiring every Vite app carries. Both are built with `tsc` and publish `./dist` via their `exports` map, so without the alias, editing a shared component shows nothing here until a rebuild — which defeats the entire purpose.
- **`@tanstack/react-router` is in `dedupe`** alongside `react`/`react-dom`. `@unimatrix/chrome` declares it as a peer; two resolved copies means the shell's `useRouterState` reads a router context `RouterProvider` never wrote to.
- **The stylesheet turns Tailwind's automatic source detection off (`source(none)`) and lists every scanned path itself.** Unlike the apps, this is not a convenience: `lab/prototypes/` is gitignored, Tailwind skips gitignored paths, and while automatic detection is on its workspace-wide source makes that filter apply to every other `@source` too — so no directive of any shape reaches a prototype. The reasoning, the measurement and the per-depth prototype lines are in `src/styles.css`; read the comments there before editing any line of it. Nothing but a browser catches a mistake — lint, types and every automated check stay green while prototypes render half-styled.
- **Banned imports** (enforced by `no-restricted-imports` in `eslint.config.mjs`, and **only under `lab/src/`** — `lab/prototypes/` is excluded from lint, so nothing stops a prototype importing them; containment is the absence of a deploy artifact, not this rule): `@unimatrix/api-client`, `@unimatrix/user-data`, `@unimatrix/auth/react`, `@unimatrix/auth/server`, `@clerk/*`. The bare `@unimatrix/auth` entry is allowed and used — it is the permission scheme, and nothing else.

## 6. Known costs, accepted rather than solved

- `pnpm install` installs lab's dependencies in CI, which never needs them.
- **Dependabot watches `lab/package.json`** and will open PRs for a dev-only harness. Accepted deliberately: an unsupported or malformed key makes Dependabot reject `.github/dependabot.yml` entirely, silently disabling npm updates repo-wide, and a rejected config looks exactly like a quiet week. A few dev-harness PRs is the cheaper failure.
- A prototype rots against `packages/ui` and `packages/chrome` changes. Correct for throwaway work.
