 * The UX prototyping harness. Local-dev only: there is no `build` script, no
 * Dockerfile, no compose file, and no CI image job, so this config is only ever
 * read by `vite` in dev mode. A `preview` block would be dead configuration
 * describing a build that never happens.
 *
 * No `tanstackRouter` plugin, unlike the three apps. The router here is written
 * by hand (`src/app/router.tsx`) and prototypes are discovered with
 * `import.meta.glob` instead of file-based codegen, because a generated route
 * tree would churn on every prototype added or deleted — in a directory whose
 * entire point is to stay empty on `main`.
