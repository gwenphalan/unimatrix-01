## 1. Overview
`packages/auth` is the shared Clerk-backed authentication and permission-scheme boundary for the monorepo. It defines the single source of truth for how permissions are shaped and stored, plus thin Fastify and React integration layers built on top of it.

## 2. Folder Structure
- `src/permissions.ts`: framework-agnostic permission scheme — `AppSlug`, `Role`, `AdminSection`, the `UserPermissionsMetadata`/`SessionPermissionsClaim` shapes, and the `hasPermission`/`isAdmin`/`canAccessAdminSection` pure helpers.
- `src/index.ts`: barrel for the `.` entry point (re-exports `permissions.ts`).
- `src/server.ts`: the `./server` entry point — `registerClerkAuth` (wraps `@clerk/fastify`'s `clerkPlugin`), `requireAuth`/`requirePermission`/`requireAdminSection` preHandler guards, `getAuthUserId`, `getSessionPermissionsClaim`, and the `AuthError` class. Node-only.
- `src/react.tsx`: the `./react` entry point — `AuthProvider` (wraps `@clerk/clerk-react`'s `ClerkProvider` and applies the shared `unimatrixClerkAppearance`), the `usePermissions` hook, and thin re-exports of commonly used Clerk components/hooks. Browser-only.
- `test/permissions.test.ts`: coverage for the pure `.` helpers, including malformed-input handling.

## 3. Core Behaviors & Patterns
- **Three isolated entry points**: `.` is zero-runtime-dependency and safe to import anywhere; `./server` is Node-only and depends on `@clerk/fastify`/`fastify`; `./react` is browser-only and depends on `@clerk/clerk-react`/`react`. Never import `./server` from `./react` or vice versa, and never add a runtime dependency to `.`.
- **No `process.env` reads inside this package**: every Clerk key (`secretKey`, `publishableKey`, `jwtKey`, `publishableKey` for the frontend) is passed in explicitly by the consuming app through function/prop options. This keeps the package portable across `apps/api`, `apps/web`, and `apps/auth`.
- **Single source of truth for permission shape**: `UserPermissionsMetadata` (Clerk `publicMetadata`) and `SessionPermissionsClaim` (the custom JWT claim) are both defined once in `src/permissions.ts`. `./server` and `./react` both build on the same `hasPermission`/`isAdmin` helpers rather than re-implementing permission checks.
- **One predicate per admin section, in `.`**: every `apps/admin` section gates on `canAccessAdminSection(perms, section)`, backed by the private `ADMIN_SECTION_PERMISSIONS` table. Today every section maps to `auth:admin`, so it equals `isAdmin`. `./server`'s `requireAdminSection()` *wraps* that predicate — do not re-derive the check there, or a later per-section capability scheme stops being a one-file change.
- **`AuthError` is designed to be caught downstream**: it exposes `kind`, `statusCode`, and `code` so `apps/api`'s `normalizeError` maps it into `apps/api`'s `ApiError`/`normalizeError` pattern without this package importing from `apps/api` (that would be circular).
- **No dependency on `@unimatrix/shared`**: the dependency direction stays one-way (`apps/api` depends on both). Keep this package free of `@unimatrix/shared` imports so it never risks a cycle.

## 4. Conventions
- **Naming**: `require*` for Fastify preHandler factories, `has*`/`is*`/`can*` for pure permission predicates, `use*` for the React hook.
- **Types**: Keep the permission scheme's exported types (`AppSlug`, `Role`, `UserPermissionsMetadata`, `SessionPermissionsClaim`) as the canonical shapes; don't redefine permission shapes locally in consuming apps.
- **Structure**: Add new framework-agnostic permission logic to `src/permissions.ts`; add new Fastify-specific behavior to `src/server.ts`; add new React-specific behavior to `src/react.tsx`. Don't collapse the three entry points into one file.
