          edge — entirely outside the border, not straddling it — and `ml-2`
          (8px) opens a small gap past that edge. `top-3` matches the rail's
          `p-3` padding, and both this button and the wordmark link below are
          `h-9`, so their centres land on the same line. Because the position
          is relative to the rail's own edge rather than a fixed offset, it
          does not move when the rail's width changes between collapsed and
          expanded, and it does not depend on the button's own width either. */}

      {/* The slot is a `ReactNode` the package cannot measure or restyle, and
          collapsed the rail is narrower than plenty of plausible controls —
          Clerk's signed-in `<UserButton />` is an avatar that fits, its
          signed-out button is text that does not. Without this the control
          escapes the rail on both sides and paints over the content region.
          `block` is doing real work: a slot rendering an inline `<a>` ignores
          `max-width` entirely, so clipping it needs a block box first.

          Expanded, `pl-2` is the same 8px the wordmark link above uses, and
          for the same reason: it is what puts a 24px control's centre on the
          32px column the section icons sit on. A slot that renders something
          other than 24px wide will not land there — the shell cannot measure
          the slot, so the app supplying it owns matching that size. Collapsed,
          the rail centres it instead and the padding is dropped.

          `border-y` frames the control with a rule on both sides, matching
          the top one already separating it from the nav. `mb-2` nudges it up
          from the rail's bottom edge; it lives on this div rather than on the
          rail's own `p-3` because other comments in this file key the
          toggle button's `top-3` offset and the wordmark's `pl-2` centering
          off that value, and growing it would misalign both. */}
