/**
 * Per-workspace import bans from the Boundaries section of `AGENTS.md`.
 *
 * This layer exists alongside `boundaries/dependencies` because the two fail in
 * different directions. `boundaries` reasons about *resolved* modules, so an
 * import it cannot resolve is classified as external and skipped — which is
 * exactly what an undeclared, newly-added forbidden dependency looks like
 * before its tsconfig path exists. `no-restricted-imports` matches the
 * specifier string itself and therefore fires whether or not the module
 * resolves.
 *
 * Every entry below is satisfied by the repo as it stands, so these are
 * ratchets against new violations rather than a list of known failures.
 *
 * `files` is deliberately not uniform. A *dependency* ban applies everywhere,
 * because importing the package from a test still means adding it to
 * `package.json`. A *purity* ban ("must stay filesystem-free") applies to
 * `src/**` only, because it is a statement about what the package ships — the
 * repo's own convention tests read source files off disk to enforce
 * conventions, and banning `node:fs` in those would be enforcing the rule
 * against the thing enforcing the rule.
