 * must stay hidden. The Clerk publishable key ships inside the `apps/admin`
 * and `apps/auth` bundles and is confidential from nobody, and it is still

 *
 * The declaration stays here rather than beside the code that consumes it
 * because consumers can share an integration: two modules needing the same
